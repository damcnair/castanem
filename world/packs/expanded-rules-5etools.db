These can change over time as characters grow, overcome old fears, and discover new uncertainties. Work with players to determine when their Seeds of Fear might change.</p><p>A character never has more than three Seeds of Fear; if you gain a new seed and already have three, choose which of your old fears is replaced by the new one.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Seeds of Fear</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d12]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Seed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I can't stand dark places.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I'm terrified of a particular kind of animal.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Deep water will be the death of me.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I can't stand heights.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I hate being stuck in tight spaces.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Being around crowds unnerves me, for I always feel judged.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I hate feeling isolated or being alone.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Storms and extreme weather rattle me.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"9\">9</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Being followed chills my blood.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"10\">10</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Sudden noises or appearances fray my nerves.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"11\" data-roll-max=\"11\">11</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"I can't be comfortable around creatures larger than I am.\"</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"12\" data-roll-max=\"12\">12</td><td class=\"col-10\">\"Reflections always seem like they're looking straight through me.\"</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7377\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Seeds of Fear</span></span> <p>When a character encounters one of their Seeds of Fear, and interacts with the situation in a way that reinforces the seed, such as screaming or stumbling back from a horrid event, consider giving the character inspiration for their fear-focused reaction (see \"Inspiration\" in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>).

If the player portrays the character's response in a way that reinforces that fear, such as refusing and finding another way around, taking time and making noise to widen the crack, or portraying some other fearful response, these would be perfect opportunities to reward the player's consideration of a Seed of Fear by granting their character inspiration.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fear</span></span> <p>An overwhelming foe or horrid monster doesn't need magic or some supernatural ability to strike fear into the most stalwart adventurers.

Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Other roles focus on keeping the crew's health and morale in order. The roles are meant to provide a sense of the types of ability checks useful to managing a ship. Of these, though, captain is the only role that must be filled for the ship to function. A ship needs a single person to issue orders and respond to threats, otherwise a ship risks chaos and confusion during a crisis.</p><p>Each type of officer is described below, along with the abilities and proficiencies that help a character excel in that role:</p><p><b>Captain</b>. The captain issues orders. The best captains have high Intelligence and Charisma scores, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and the <span class=\"help help--hover\">Intimidation</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\">Persuasion</span> skills.</p><p><b>First Mate</b>. This specialist keeps the crew's morale high by providing supervision, encouragement, and discipline. A first mate benefits from a high Charisma score, as well as proficiency with the <span class=\"help help--hover\">Intimidation</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\">Persuasion</span> skills.</p><p><b>Bosun</b>. The bosun (or boatswain) provides technical advice to the captain and crew and leads repair and maintenance efforts. A good bosun has a high Strength score, as well as proficiency with @item[carpenter's tools|PHB] and the <span class=\"help help--hover\">Athletics</span> skill.</p><p><b>Quartermaster</b>. The quartermaster plots the ship's course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable quartermaster tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as proficiency with @item[navigator's tools|PHB] and the <span class=\"help help--hover\">Nature</span> skill.</p><p><b>Surgeon</b>. The ship's surgeon tends to injuries, keeps illnesses from spreading throughout the ship, and oversees sanitation. A capable surgeon benefits from a high Intelligence score, as well as proficiency with @item[Herbalism Kit|PHB|herbalism kits] and the <span class=\"help help--hover\">Medicine</span> skill.</p><p><b>Cook</b>. A ship's cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew's morale in top shape, while a poor one drags down the entire crew's performance. A talented cook has a high Constitution score, as well as proficiency with @item[brewer's supplies|PHB] and @item[cook's utensils|PHB].</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7486\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crew Members</span></span> <p>A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship activities, like the crew's ability to notice threats or contend with hazards. A crew starts with a quality score of +4, but that score varies over time, going as low as −10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health.

Once per day, if a crew's quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\">Intimidation</span> or <span class=\"help help--hover\">Persuasion</span>) check modified by the crew's quality score.</p><p>If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew's quality score decreases by 1.</p><p>If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard.

{"name":"Customizing Your Origin","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a typical character race in D&amp;D includes little or no choice—a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7314\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ability Score Increases</span></span> <p>Whatever D&amp;D race you choose for your character, you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&amp;D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&amp;D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.</p><p>If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.</p><p>For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7315\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages</span></span> <p>Your character's race includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&amp;D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.</p><p>To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.</p><p>Your DM may add or remove languages from that list, depending on what languages are appropriate for your campaign.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7316\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proficiencies</span></span> <p>Some races and subraces grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culture in question or might have pursued different training. You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Proficiency Swaps</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Proficiency</th><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Replacement Proficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Skill</td><td class=\"col-6\">Skill</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Armor</td><td class=\"col-6\">Simple/martial weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Simple weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">Simple weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Martial weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">Simple/martial weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Tool</td><td class=\"col-6\">Tool or simple weapon</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For example, high elf adventurers have proficiency with longswords, which are martial weapons.

{"name":"Sleep","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Just as in the real world, D&amp;D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the @condition[unconscious] condition.

A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.</p><p>Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7620\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sleeping in Armor</span></span> <p>Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.</p><p>When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die).

{"name":"Initiative Variants","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>This section offers different ways to handle initiative.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7398\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Initiative Score</span></span> <p>With this optional rule, creatures don't roll initiative at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 10 + Dexterity modifier.</p><p>By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, and the process of asking for and recording totals, you can speed your game up considerably—at the cost of an initiative order that is often predictable.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7399\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Side Initiative</span></span> <p>Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arranging everyone in the correct order, and remembering where you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule.</p><p>Under this variant, the players roll a [[/r d20]] for their initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a [[/r d20]]. Neither roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie is broken.</p><p>When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends when both sides have completed their turns.</p><p>If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the battle is complete.</p><p>This variant encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative can gang up on enemies and take them out before they have a chance to act.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7400\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Speed Factor</span></span> <p>Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes before the monster and can heal him.</p><p>Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or monster must choose an action.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7401\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Initiative Modifiers.</span></span> <p>Modifiers might apply to a creature's initiative depending on its size and the action it takes. For example, a creature that fights with a light weapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act before a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. See the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for details. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has no effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon, apply them all to the initiative roll.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Factor</th><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Initiative Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Spellcasting</td><td class=\"col-6\">Subtract the spell's level</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Melee, heavy weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">-2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Melee, light or finesse weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Melee, two-handed weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">-2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Ranged, loading weapon</td><td class=\"col-6\">-5</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Creature Size</th><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Initiative Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Tiny</td><td class=\"col-6\">+5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Small</td><td class=\"col-6\">+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Medium</td><td class=\"col-6\">+0</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Large</td><td class=\"col-6\">-2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Huge</td><td class=\"col-6\">-5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Gargantuan</td><td class=\"col-6\">-8</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Don't apply the same modifier more than once on a creature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only the modifier from the highest-level spell.</p><p>Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that creature's turn, remembering never to apply the same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a shortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total modifier of +0.</p><p>The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it when adjudicating any actions a character takes that you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions should grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or penalty of 2 or 5 for an action.</p><p>For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could rule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7402\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rolling Initiative.</span></span> <p>After deciding on an action, everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping the result secret. You then announce an initiative number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act first. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7403\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Turns.</span></span> <p>On its turn, a creature moves as normal but must take the action it selected or take no action at all.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Once everyone has acted, the process repeats.

Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land.

{"name":"Facing","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.</p><p>A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.</p><p>Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and left arcs.</p><p>Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.</p><p>On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.</p><p>A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc.</p></div></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"I1yx0D5xVB4ZYInE"}

A few features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7429\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Channel Divinity</span></span> <p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7430\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Extra Attack</span></span> <p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7431\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unarmored Defense</span></span> <p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7432\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting</span></span> <p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7433\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spells Known and Prepared.</span></span> <p>You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7434\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Slots.</span></span> <p>You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @spell[burning hands], has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3. you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7435\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pact Magic.</span></span> <p>If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell

{"name":"Haunted Traps","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Like other traps, haunted traps represent threats leveled toward trespassers. They originate in an area spontaneously, often resulting from overwhelming negative emotions, tragedy, or evil. Just as some terrible fates might cause a tormented individual to rise as an undead creature, so might supernatural evil and violent emotions manifest more generally as one or more haunted traps. Such traps provide a way to theme the dangers and monsters of a haunted place to reveal a grim history or frightening tale. When creating haunted traps, consider what events brought them into being and how the trap's effects suggest those origins.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7388\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Detecting Haunted Traps</span></span> <p>Every haunted trap has an emanation, which might be as subtle as a drop in temperature or as overt as an object moving of its own accord. A haunted trap's emanation occurs before the trap takes effect. A character notices the emanation if their passive Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\">Perception</span>) score equals or exceeds 10 + the trap's Haunt Bonus. A character who notices the haunted trap has until the start of their next turn to react, which might include fleeing to avoid the trap or attempting to disarm it (see the following section). Class features and spells, such as Divine Sense and @spell[detect evil and good], that discern desecration also detect haunted traps.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7389\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Disarming Haunted Traps</span></span> <p>Characters who notice a haunted trap before it activates can attempt to disarm it. Typical methods of disarming traps, such as thieves' tools and @spell[dispel magic], don't affect haunted traps. However, the Channel Divinity class feature and the @spell[remove curse] spell can disarm a haunted trap.</p><p>To use Channel Divinity to disarm a haunted trap, a character uses an action to present their holy symbol and speak a prayer. To use @spell[remove curse] instead, a character must cast the spell and touch an object that is part of the trap. Whichever disarming method is used, the trap itself then makes a saving throw against the character's spell save DC, adding its Haunt Bonus to the save. On a failure, the trap is disarmed for 24 hours. If the trap fails the save by 10 or more, the trap is disarmed permanently.</p><p>Depending on the haunted trap's origins, certain spells might also affect the trap. For example, a haunted trap with a fiendish origin might be permanently disarmed by the spell @spell[dispel evil and good].</p><p>Some haunted traps might also be disarmed in nonmagical ways related to the history of a haunted area. Such methods might be as simple as wearing the clothes of a haunted house's former owner or singing a lullaby that soothes a restless spirit. Haunted traps disarmed in such ways typically remain disarmed for 24 hours.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7390\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sample Haunted Traps</span></span> <p>Several haunted traps are presented here in alphabetical order.

When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant, mournful music. A round later, a phantom performer appears and begins playing the instrument for the next minute. While the performer plays, any creature that enters or starts its turn in the haunted trap's area must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or float 20 feet into the air and be affected by the spell @spell[Otto's irresistible dance]. There they are joined by illusory dancers as they dance for the remainder of the performer's song. As an action, a dancing creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself, whereupon it falls 20 feet and takes [[/r 2d6]] bludgeoning damage. If a creature's saving throw to resist the trap or to stop dancing is successful, the creature is immune to the haunted trap for the next 24 hours.</p><p>While the phantom performer plays, any creature within the haunted trap's area can use an action to try to convince the performer to stop playing, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\">Persuasion</span>) check. When the performer stops playing, all creatures affected by the haunted trap are freed from its effects and float to the ground safely.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7392\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Faceless Malice</span></span> <p><i>Haunt Bonus +2</i></p><p>This haunted trap affects a 15-foot-cube in front of an ornate mirror hanging on a wall. When a visible creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the creature's distorted reflection in the mirror. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[blinded], @condition[deafened], and rendered unable to speak for 1 minute. Additionally, an illusion makes it appear that the creature has had its face erased. The @spell[remove curse] spell ends this effect, as does destroying the mirror.

Once per day, when a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant flapping wings and a rush of warm air. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] and @condition[incapacitated] for 1 minute. These conditions last until the creature is damaged or someone else uses an action to shake the creature. If the affected creature remains @condition[charmed] for the full minute, they are then affected as per the spell @spell[magic jar], their soul entering the statue and being replaced by the spirit of a disembodied fiend.

If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, an illusory scene plays out, repeating some terrible event that happened in the area. This vision typically lasts 1 minute.

{"name":"Spell Points","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.</p><p>In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.</p><p>Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.</p><p>The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.</p><p>The Spell Points by Level table applies to @class[bard||bards], @class[cleric||clerics], @class[druid||druids], @class[sorcerer||sorcerers], and @class[wizard||wizards].

For a @class[fighter|phb|fighter (Eldritch Knight)|Eldritch Knight] or @class[rogue|phb|rogue (Arcane Trickster)|Arcane Trickster], divide the character's level in that class by three.</p><p>This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so.

{"name":"Inspiration","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7404\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Awarding Inspiration</span></span> <p>Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.</p><p>Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of action fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer to those questions help determine when you award inspiration.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7405\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying.</span></span> <p>Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7406\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Heroism.</span></span> <p>You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a [[/r d20]] roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure—and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7407\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Reward for Victory.</span></span> <p>Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7408\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Genre Emulation.</span></span> <p>Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: \"I can 't resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.\" If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.</p><p>A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7409\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Players and Inspiration.</span></span> <p>Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7410\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">When Do You Award Inspiration</span></span> <p>Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.</p><p>Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling tale together.</p><p>Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7411\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tracking Inspiration</span></span> <p>A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token. Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the [[/r d20]] can go to that other person.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7412\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ignoring Inspiration</span></span> <p>Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration.</p><p>If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7413\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Only Players Award Inspiration</span></span> <p>As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.</p><p>This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.</p><p>This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.</p><p>In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.</p></div></div></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"Ne9tn1lARILBO5JT"}
{"name":"Rest Variants","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style campaign.

Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7559\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gritty Realism</span></span> <p>This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days.

Three options are presented below.</p><p>A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 plot point.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7528\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 1: What a Twist!</span></span> <p>A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.</p><p>A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7529\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 2: The Plot Thickens</span></span> <p>Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene.

Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.</p><p>At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.</p><p>Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.</p><p>In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.</p><p>For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's plans.</p></div></div></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"SbMQI1dqm93zMD4u"}

It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.</p><p>Potions of healing and spell scrolls are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see \"Brewing Potions of Healing\" later in this section and the \"Scribing a Spell Scroll\" section, below.</p><p>To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.</p><p>An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.</p><p>The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Magic Item Ingredients</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Item Rarity</th><th class=\"col-6 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">CR Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Common</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">1—3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Uncommon</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">4—8</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Rare</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">9—12</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Very rare</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">13—18</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\">Legendary</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">19+</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating mariner's armor might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a staff of charming might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a staff of power might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic—a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.</p><p>In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.

At 1st level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the character's Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain proficiency.</p><p>This option removes skills from the game and doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can't choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7617\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Background Proficiency</span></span> <p>With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character's prior training and experience (reflected in the character's background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character's background applies.</p><p>For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character's background applies. Not simply \"I'm a noble,\" but \"I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature to me now.\"</p><p>This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters' histories. Don't let it result in endless debates about whether a character's proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the character's background makes everyone else at the table roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the player for making the effort.</p><p>If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to \"situations where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount\" and \"figuring out the secret plots that court members hatch against one another.\"</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7618\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Personality Trait Proficiency</span></span> <p>With this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character's positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of \"I never have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go along\" might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a character.</p><p>When a character's negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is \"I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings\" might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sneaking up.</p><p>If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personality trait.</p><p>This system relies heavily on players developing their characters' personalities. Make sure that different characters' traits—positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and a negative trait that never does.</p><p>At your discretion, you can also tie a character's ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system.</p></div></div></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"W2CdlwLFlP4XgiQC"}

{"name":"Automatic Success","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Sometimes the randomness of a [[/r d20]] roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges.</p><p>If such results bother you, allow automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.</p><p>The downside of this approach is its predictability. Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always try to match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.</p><p>You can modify this rule to account for proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score.

Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their profession.</p><p>A character who comes into possession of a common, uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure or quest.</p><p>For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table.</p><p>A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple magic items at once. Although this requires multiple Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren't added together.

A storm on land might bog down a caravan, delaying its trip by a few days, while at sea a storm can split a ship in two and send everyone aboard to their doom. The close quarters of life aboard a ship leads to short tempers and brawls, while a few rats that sneak aboard can spread disease and spoil supplies. This section presents a variety of common hazards sailors might face on the sea.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7821\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Group Checks</span></span> <p>To determine how a ship fares against these hazards, each threat requires the ship's officers and crew to make a special group check (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,7,group%20checks,0\">chapter 7</a> of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for how group checks work). The description of a hazard specifies which officers can roll to contribute to the group check. That description also states what ability check an officer makes. Even if the officers make different ability checks, their successes and failures contribute to the one group check.</p><p>Additionally, all the non-officer members of the crew make a single check, a [[/r d20]] roll modified by the crew's quality. The success or failure of all these checks—both the officers and the crew—determines the result of the group check.</p><p>While each hazard lists the officers assigned to participate in a group check, anyone can attempt an officer's check in a pinch, with two exceptions: First, only the captain can make checks associated with the captain's role; no one else can take the captain's place. Second, only one character can attempt an officer's check; they can't receive help.</p><p>Once all the checks related to the group check have been rolled, the ship's success or failure is determined. Hazards offer four levels of success or failure determined by the results of the ship's group check. A total success or a total failure occurs when every roll in the group check is a success or a failure, respectively.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7822\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Determining Hazards</span></span> <p>Traveling by sea is an innately dangerous proposition. When running an ocean adventure, you can select hazards based on the needs of your campaign or generate them randomly.</p><p>To determine hazards at random, roll a [[/r d20]] at the start of each day of an ocean voyage. On a 20, the ship faces a hazard that day. Use the following two tables to determine the nature of the hazard and the DC of the threat it presents. Specifics corresponding to each of these DC levels are detailed along with each of the following hazards.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Hazard Type</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"text-center col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Hazard Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"3\">1-3</td><td class=\"col-10\">Crew conflict</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"6\">4-6</td><td class=\"col-10\">Fire</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"9\">7-9</td><td class=\"col-10\">Fog</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"12\">10-12</td><td class=\"col-10\">Infestation</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"13\" data-roll-max=\"20\">13-20</td><td class=\"col-10\">Storm</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Hazard DC</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"text-center col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Hazard DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"9\">1-9</td><td class=\"col-10\">10</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"17\">10-17</td><td class=\"col-10\">15</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"18\" data-roll-max=\"19\">18-19</td><td class=\"col-10\">20</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center col-2\" data-roll-min=\"20\" data-roll-max=\"20\">20</td><td class=\"col-10\">25</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7823\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crew Conflict</span></span> <p>Sailors can be a rough-and-tumble bunch, and cramming them into a ship's confined quarters leads to inevitable rivalries, feuds, and petty crimes.

{"name":"Falling","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. The rule given in the Player's Handbook is simple: at the end of a fall, you take [[/r 1d6]] bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of [[/r 20d6]]. You also land @condition[prone], unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7372\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rate of Falling</span></span> <p>The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a @creature[griffon] or on board an @item[airship]? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.</p><p>When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7373\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flying Creatures and Falling</span></span> <p>A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked @condition[prone], if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the @spell[fly] spell.</p><p>If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked @condition[prone] but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.</p><p>If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is @condition[prone], it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the @condition[prone] condition (as if it were standing up in midair).</p></div></div></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"dlLAUABY5Ux92ai6"}
{"name":"Spellcasting","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>This section expands on the spellcasting rules presented in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, providing clarifications and new options.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7622\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Perceiving a Caster at Work</span></span> <p>Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.</p><p>But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.</p><p>If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7623\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Identifying a Spell</span></span> <p>Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.</p><p>If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.</p><p>This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7624\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Invalid Spell Targets</span></span> <p>A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, or something else. But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast charm person on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.</p><p>If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7625\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Areas of Effect on a Grid</span></span> <p>The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.</p><p>Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"Areas of Effect\" section in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.</p><p>That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7626\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Template Method</span></span> <p>The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7627\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Making a Template.</span></span> <p>Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the fireball spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7628\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using a Template.</span></span> <p>To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.</p><p>When you place a template, follow all the rules in the Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.</p><p>Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/variantrules/001.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/variantrules/001.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7629\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Token Method</span></span> <p>The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.</p><p>Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7630\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Tokens.</span></span> <p>Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect.

These rules take a creature with a low challenge rating and give it levels in one of three simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.</p><p>A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them during the campaign. For example, the characters might meet a villager, an animal, or another creature, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to join them on their adventures.</p><p>You can also use these rules to customize a monster for your own use as DM.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7609\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sidekick</span></span> <p>A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat block in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#MM\">Monster Manual</a> or another D&amp;D book, but the challenge rating in its stat block must be <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge%20rating:min=&amp;0~max=&amp;1/2,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2\">½ or lower</a>. You take that stat block and add to it, as explained in the \"Gaining a Sidekick Class\" section.</p><p>To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the friend of at least one of them. This friendship might be connected to a character's backstory or to events that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you determine whether there is sufficient trust established for the creature to join the group.</p><p>You decide who plays the sidekick.

{"name":"Ship Stat Blocks","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>To aid in running adventures where ships engage in combat, undertake precise navigation, or face situations where their various capabilities become relevant, the following section presents new rules and stat blocks for a spectrum of vessels.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7569\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Basic Statistics</span></span> <p>A ship stat block has three main parts: basic statistics, components, and action options. Ships can't take any actions on their own. Without effort from its crew, a ship might drift on the water, come to a stop, or careen out of control.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7570\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Size</span></span> <p>Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7571\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Space</span></span> <p>A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space.</p><p>A ship can't move into a space that is too small to accommodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, as described in the \"Crashing a Ship\" section.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7572\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Capacity</span></span> <p>A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers don't generally engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the deep both count as passengers.</p><p>Cargo capacity notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7573\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Travel Pace</span></span> <p>A ship's travel pace determines how far the vessel can move per hour and per day. A ship's movement-related components (described later in the stat block) determine how far the vessel can move each round.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7574\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ability Scores</span></span> <p>A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers.</p><p>The Strength of a ship expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Ships usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p><p>If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7575\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</span></span> <p>A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.</p><p>Ships are typically immune to poison and psychic damage. Ships are also usually immune to the following conditions: @condition[blinded], @condition[charmed], @condition[deafened], @condition[exhaustion], @condition[frightened], @condition[incapacitated], @condition[paralyzed], @condition[petrified], @condition[poisoned], @condition[prone], @condition[stunned], and @condition[unconscious].</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7576\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Actions</span></span> <p>This part of the stat block specifies what the ship can do on its turn, using its special actions rather than the actions used by creatures. It even relies on its actions to move; it doesn't have a move otherwise. The ship's captain decides which actions to use. A given action can be chosen only once during a turn.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7577\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Components</span></span> <p>A ship is composed of different components, each of which comprises multiple objects:</p><p><b>Hull</b>. A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.</p><p><b>Control</b>. A control component is used to steer a ship.</p><p><b>Movement</b>. A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars, and has a specific speed.</p><p><b>Weapon</b>. A ship capable of being used in combat has one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately.</p><p>A ship's component might have special rules, as described in the stat block.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7578\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Armor Class</span></span> <p>A component has an Armor Class. Its AC reflects the materials used to construct it and any defensive plating used to augment its toughness.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7579\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hit Points</span></span> <p>A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed.</p><p>A ship doesn't have Hit Dice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7580\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Damage Threshold</span></span> <p>If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage that equals or exceeds its threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Damage that fails to bypass the threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"7581\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sample Ships</span></span> <p>See the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/vehicles.html#\">vehicles page</a> for stat blocks, deck plans, and other details for some of the most common ships.</p><ul class=\"rd__list columns-2\"><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Galley]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Keelboat]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Longship]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Rowboat]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Sailing Ship]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@vehicle[Warship]</li></ul><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"7582\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Siege Weapons</span></span><p>Some ships are armed with siege weapons, the descriptions of which are in the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,siege%20equipment,0\">Siege Equipment</a>\" section of chapter 8 in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.

{"name":"Downtime Activity: Carousing","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7322\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Resources</span></span> <p>Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.</p><p>A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7323\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Resolution</span></span> <p>After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Carousing</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Check Total</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">1—5</td><td class=\"col-10\">Character has made a hostile contact.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">6—10</td><td class=\"col-10\">Character has made no new contacts.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">11—15</td><td class=\"col-10\">Character has made an allied contact.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">16—20</td><td class=\"col-10\">Character has made two allied contacts.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">21+</td><td class=\"col-10\">Character has made three allied contacts.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.</p><p>Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.</p><p>Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.</p><p>Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.</p><p>Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.</p><p>You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.</p><p>Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.</p><p>Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.</p><p>The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.</p><p>At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

{"name":"Shared Campaign Variant Rules","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>A shared campaign might use some variant rules to handle certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining levels and acquiring treasure. These \"house rules,\" presented below, serve as a sort of common language, ensuring that the rewards all characters receive are equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a character experienced.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7560\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement</span></span> <p>In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not by accumulating experience points but by reaching experience checkpoints. This system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play session.</p><p>A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table. The reward for completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 2 checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours playing through it.</p><p>If a character completes an adventure designed for a tier higher than the character's current tier, the character is awarded 1 additional checkpoint. For example, if a 2nd-level character completes a 6th-level adventure designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 checkpoints.</p><p>Playing time might seem like an odd way to measure experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with how a shared campaign is meant to work. A character played for 10 hours reaches the same number of checkpoints, whether the character went up against a dragon or spent all that time lurking in a pub. This approach ensures that a player's preferred style is neither penalized nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7561\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Checkpoints</span></span> <p>The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level depends on a character's level:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">At levels 1—4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to advance to the next level.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is needed to advance to the next level.</li></ul><p>At the end of a play session, characters must level up if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so.

The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow or ban is a matter of personal preference, just as it is for the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expectations. When in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add it to the available items at a later time than it would be to remove it from the game once it has been handed out.</p><p>Naturally, the list of available items is longer for adventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those higher-tier items likewise increases. The Magic Items by Tier table provides the details.</p><p>For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure can be spent on items from tables A, B, C, and F.

This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up tool proficiencies.

This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with @item[mason's tools|phb] makes a successful Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\">Perception</span>) check to find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\">Investigation</span>) check to determine how to open the door.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7660\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tool Descriptions</span></span> <p>The following sections go into detail about the tools presented in the Player's Handbook, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7661\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Components.</span></span> <p>The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of.

{"name":"Downtime Revisited","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.</p><p>By engaging the characters in downtime activities that take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time line—one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of the story that you and the characters tell.</p><p>Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend—or be relieved of—the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures.</p><p>The system presented here consists of two elements. First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it details a number of downtime activities that characters can undertake.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7358\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rivals</span></span> <p>Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of rivals.</p><p>A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7359\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rival</span></span> <p>In essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC.

At least one should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.</p><p>The best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level.

Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Think about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described later in this section, but these are more often efforts that are specific to the rival.</p><p>A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.</p><p>Some elements of a rival's plans might involve events in the world that aren't under the rival's control.

These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.</p><p>Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7364\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Resolving Activities</span></span> <p>The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it.

Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.</p><p>Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.</p><p>The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7365\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Complications</span></span> <p>The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.</p><p>Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications.

As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.</p><p>The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a @item[wand of magic missiles] (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast @spell[magic missile]. That same character could make a @item[+1 weapon] (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.</p><p>You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created.

A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.</p><p>If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's level for each day of the creation process. The spell's material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a spell scroll, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item's creation.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.</p><p>Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, \"Treasure.\" At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop.\"</p><p>While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" of the Player's Handbook).</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"DMG\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"7325\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magic Item Formulas</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\">DMG</span> p141</span></span><p>A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item.

{"name":"Survivors","content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Terror doesn't come just for the brave and prepared—often quite the opposite. Some of the most harrowing horror stories involve the least likely heroes, individuals who find their simple lives transformed into waking nightmares.</p><p>In most horror adventures, your players will employ familiar, adventure-ready characters. That doesn't need to be the case, though. Instead, for short, low-power adventures, immersive retellings of tragic events, out-of-body experiences, or other unique tales, consider providing players with temporary, stand-in characters called survivors.</p><p>This section provides guidance for using survivors, characters designed for one- to three-session adventures focused on survival rather than saving the day. Using survivors helps create horror experiences focused on the dread inherent to having limited resources and facing impending doom without forcing players to risk their favorite characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7639\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Survivors</span></span> <p>Survivors are premade characters that are simple and easy for players to master, while being customizable enough to fill broad roles in your adventures—whether they be farmers or bored nobles, constables or babysitters.

Even if it doesn't make sense for a campaign's characters to be present for an event, survivors can provide players with perspectives they wouldn't otherwise have. For example, you might use survivors in the following ways:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Survivors serve as the first constables on the scene during a serial killer's crime. Afterward, when the players' other characters get involved in the investigations, the players know the details.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Survivors give every player a part to play in one character's ominous nightmares, such as those resulting from encounters with the mind flayers of Bluetspur (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#VRGR,3\">chapter 3</a>).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Survivors provide players front row seats to important historic events. It's one thing to hear about the massacre at Castle Ravenloft following Strahd von Zarovich's transformation into a vampire, but it's another to play it.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7641\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mindtaker Mists</span></span> <p>The Mists frequently kidnap characters from across the multiverse, dragging them into the Domains of Dread. They don't always claim their victims bodily, though. Rather, the Mists might steal characters' minds, placing them into survivors involved in specific terrifying scenarios. Perhaps characters suddenly find themselves mentally recast into someone defending against a zombie siege in Falkovnia, attending a ball in Dementlieu, or exploring the tombs of Har'Akir (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#VRGR,3\">chapter 3</a> for details on such adventures). Whether the characters survive or meet spectacular ends doesn't matter, as death might mean a return to the character's original body, a second chance to try again, or a stranger fate.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7642\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Terrible Freedom, Delightful Doom</span></span> <p>Make sure your players know how long you plan to use survivors and that they'll be playing their usual characters again soon.

If it's important to the story, perhaps all the players use the same stat block, representing their shared experience—a group of Sneaks might all be detectives while a band of Disciples might face a terror unleashed upon a monastery. You can also allow players to choose their own survivors, as any survivor might fill a general role like noble, villager, or sailor with a touch of talent. Make use of these ready-made characters in whatever ways suit your adventure best.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7645\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Survivor</span></span> <p>When you plan a session using survivors, determine how you'll use the <b>Apprentice</b>, <b>Disciple</b>, <b>Sneak</b>, and <b>Squire</b> stat blocks that appear in the following section. Once you've determined what survivors to use, take a few moments to individualize them. If the survivors have particular roles in your adventure, provide that information to players along with their survivors' statistics; otherwise, let them come up with their own details. Players can give their survivors names, personalities, and lineages, but these details don't affect the survivors' stat blocks.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7646\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Levels</span></span> <p>Survivors don't possess classes as detailed in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>. Despite this, you can make a survivor marginally more powerful by increasing its level. The stat blocks present the survivors as they are at 1st level. Rather than gaining experience points, a survivor increases in level whenever it makes sense for your adventure. When a survivor gains a level, it gains the benefits on the Survivor Progression table. A survivor that advances from 1st to 2nd level and from 2nd to 3rd level gains access to the player's choice of Survivor Talents (see the section below).</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Survivor Progression</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Level</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Feature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2\">1st</td><td class=\"col-10\">See the appropriate stat block</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\">2nd</td><td class=\"col-10\">Survivor Talent</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\">3rd</td><td class=\"col-10\">Survivor Talent</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7647\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hit Points</span></span> <p>Whenever a survivor gains a level, it gains one Hit Die and its hit point maximum increases.
