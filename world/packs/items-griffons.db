The rats can peer through the demiplane and see outside of the sphere through its various holes.</p>\n<p>You can use an action while holding the sphere to speak one of its three command words as described below. To do so, the sphere must have a swarm of rats inside it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Summon Giant Rat.</em></strong> When you speak the first command word, the swarm of rats coalesces into a giant rat, which magically appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This giant rat has 24 hit points and is friendly to you and your companions. It shares your initiative but takes its turn immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command the rat (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the rat takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the rat to the sphere's demiplane, at which point it becomes a swarm again. It then regains all its hit points. If the rat is reduced to 0 hit points, it and the swarm that created it disappear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Swarm Tether.</em></strong> When you speak the second command word, you also throw the sphere at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the swarm of rats exits the sphere and clings to the creature, forcing that creature to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 piercing damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, it's also grappled until the start of its next turn. The creature repeats this saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute or until it succeeds three times, at which point the swarm scatters and disappears. If the sphere misses the creature when you throw it, the action is wasted, but the swarm remains inside the sphere.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Visage of the Wererat.</em></strong> When you speak the third command word, the swarm inside the sphere disappears, but you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</li>\n<li>You have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet instead.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to transform into a giant rat (as if by the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Polymorph]{polymorph} spell) or revert back to your normal form. You retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores while in giant rat form. If you're reduced to 0 hit points while in giant rat form, you revert to your normal form and can't transform again in this way for the remainder of the effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Mark of the Rat King.</em></strong> While you're attuned to one or more other items with \"rat king\" in its name, the sphere gains the following additional property.</p>\n<p>You can summon a swarm of rats to the empty sphere using a special ritual, which takes 1 hour to perform and can be done during a short rest.

The hurricane of his thoughts quieted, and he could once again feel at peace.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>He took a deep breath and looked skyward, where he knew his Home still flew on without him. Then, a small flash of lightning, and the silhouette of something falling—no, careening— toward him.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A crooked staff, coated in rain and twisted glass, pierced the glen of flowers and brush in front of him. It was sparking and shuddering like the storm inside his heart. He grasped the crook and lifted it from the earth, holding it carefully in his hands.

You can use an action to pull a seed from the bag and place or throw it at a target or point that you can see within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can pull a seed from the bag when you make a ranged attack with a sling, using the seed as a sling bullet once on each of your turns. You choose which seed to draw from the bag each time; each one has an effect that triggers upon impact. A seed's effect is centered at the point of impact or at a point of your choice within 5 feet of the target it hits, unless otherwise specified. A seed's effect fails if there isn't a point on the ground within 5 feet of the point of impact or target. At the end of a seed's duration, it turns to a small pile of fertile soil.</p>\n<p>The following seeds can be pulled from the duffel. Up to 5 seeds can be pulled from the duffel in this way each day, regaining all expended seeds daily at dawn.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bamboo Colonnade.</strong> A dense copse of bamboo erupts from the ground in a 5-foot-radius cylinder that's up to 60 feet tall. Its area is heavily obscured, and it provides total cover. Any creature in the area when it appears is pushed to an adjacent unoccupied space and must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 3d10[Piercing] #Sovereignseed Duffel - Bamboo Colonnade]] piercing damage. The bamboo has AC 17, 60 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. It lasts for 1 hour or until it's reduced to 0 hit points.</li>\n<li><strong>Haze Bloom.</strong> When the seed impacts, you dissolve into mist and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the point.</li>\n<li><strong>Mossglove.</strong> The seed grows into an animal woven from reeds and covered in soft moss. It takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 1 or lower and appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the point of impact. You choose the form in which it takes. If the beast normally has a flying speed, this one doesn't. It's considered a plant, is vulnerable to fire damage, and is friendly to you and your companions. The animal obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you) and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The animal remains for 1 hour, until it's reduced to 0 hit points, or until this seed is used again.</li>\n<li><strong>Seismycelium.</strong> Mycelium weaves through the ground in a 20-foot cube. When a creature other than you enters this area or moves inside it, the mycelium bursts: destroying itself and blasting debris outward. Each creature within 10 feet of the cube must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 3d12[Bludgeoning] #Sovereignseed Duffel -  Seismycelium]] bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The mycelium lasts for 1 hour if it isn't triggered.</li>\n<li><strong>Twisting Thistle.</strong> This seed replicates the effects of the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Entangle]{entangle} spell (save DC 17), centered on the seed, with the following change: a creature restrained by the weeds and vines takes 2d6 piercing damage from the plants' thorns at the start of each of its turns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Sovereign Synergy.</em></strong> If you have a <em>sovereignseed satchel</em>, you can use an action to transplant one of its seeds to the duffel. If you spend at least 1 hour per day for the next 7 days tending to the seed, it takes root and is added to the <em>sovereignseed duffel's</em> seed options. If the transplanted seed has a saving throw, its DC is increased to 17.

Suspended in the center of a colossal granite vault, it was built from fifteen layers of hardened, impenetrable glass, each with a wholly unique and equally unbreakable mechanism to keep it permanently secured. That the internal workings were visible was, in fact, part of its pride: though each piece could be seen through the walls, none who had tried could easily puzzle out the solutions. What served it best was that it, in fact, had no magic: while magic had gone into its construction, its resilience was wholly mundane and, through that, exceptional. The enchantment on the room itself, however, was a notable one: were any pane of glass inside to break, the entire space would flood with an intense, destructive acid. The glass and its contents would be unharmed, but anyone outside... it wouldn't do to think about. This was alongside a number of wards that denied instant transportation in or out of the area, as well as a few other traditional tricks to a would-be thief's bane. All this to preserve a weapon once said to have brought about the death of a god, a dagger forged from the heart of a dead world.</em></p><p><em>And so, when the keeper of the vault began his usual rounds, content in the knowledge that everything would be in its place, he was rather shocked to see, through the perfect clarity of the glass, an almost-empty pedestal.</em></p><p><em>It took hours before each lock was disengaged safely, and once that task was finished the curators of the vault stood, aghast, at the note it contained.</em></p><p></p><p><em><em>Esteemed keepers of this vault,</em></em></p><p></p><p><em><em>Salutations! If you are reading this, you've doubtless seen my handiwork. I wish you no ill-will, but have simply tested my mind and mettle against yours, to the only end to which that would lead. By now, you must be wondering what purpose I would put an artifact such as this to, but I assure you there is no cause for alarm. I, too, am a great lover of the preservation of history and couldn't stand to see such a fine example of craftsmanship waste away without its original use. So, for now, it is safe in my hands, and I wish you best of luck in the aftermath.</em></em></p><p></p><p><em><em>None but my own,</em></em></p><p><em><em>—The Ravenheart</em></em></p><p></p><p><em>The curators were speechless.

The creature takes [[/r 3d4[Psychic] #Gloves of Mimicry - Pinch, psychic]] psychic damage and [[/r 3d4[Force] #Gloves of Mimicry - Pinch, force]] force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature was concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Taunt.</strong></em> You can use an action to remove one of the gloves and expend 1 of their charges to visually slap a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you with it—as if you were challenging it to a duel. That creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 2d4[Psychic] #Gloves of Mimicry - Taunt, psychic]] psychic damage and [[/r 2d4[Force] #Gloves of Mimicry - Pinch, force]] force damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't suffer disadvantage on its attack rolls.

Any swallowed pages containing spells, magical sigils, or arcane scrolls are harmlessly spat back out by the tome. However, any notes, spells, or magical sigils that are written in the tome (instead of having been eaten by it) can be recalled if they're either dated, labeled, or titled. Written commentary, notes, and other such addenda to documents within the tome are saved by it and appear whenever the document is recalled again.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":null,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true},"ownership":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674420968137,"modifiedTime":1687035982581,"lastModifiedBy":"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02"}}
