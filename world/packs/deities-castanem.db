It does not have an agreed upon appearance, its symbol is any splatter of blood in no particular pattern, and it has only a title.

{"name":"3-7-1 Gods & Incarnates","content":"<p style=\"text-align:center\">The common man may hear stories of a nigh-omnipotent entity that can outrace light or control the sun and assume they are a god, but they are so much more. As a metaphor, you can consider the average human as plankton while a god would be a megalodon, well in this metaphor an incarnate would be the ocean itself. An incarnate is not just a being that controls an aspect of reality, it is a fundamental concept given form and thought. Unlike a god which is simply an unimaginably powerful being an incarnate is less a living thing and more of a construct housing the very essence of reality in its different shades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">If you believe the legends, it is said that the incarnates have existed since the beginning of existence itself, being influenced by the powers of the old gods. These old gods are those that were once worshipped as we do the incarnates, but have since fallen to the wayside to be prayed to only by pagans. One day, the god Yonda Noe came across a mountain in the vague shape of a human and decided to practice her teachings in front of it. Over the years the mountain absorbed these teachings and eventually awakened, becoming the first incarnate All-Mother Zoin. Alone in the world, Zoin decided to create forms for others like her to inhabit which Yonda Noe would happily teach, excited at the prospect of new entities to learn about.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">First came the One of Courage Tharros whose light acted as a beacon for the other incarnates to follow into their forms, but who's shadow also allowed the One of Strife Tromazo to slip into this world unseen. Next came the Fecundent Anaptyx and her twin the Rotten Golthgora, followed by the  Master of the Hunt Kynigos assisting the Keeper of Twilight Peraste in her search for eternity. When eternity arrived it was as the Racer of Finality Diafigi who quickly kicked a rock at the head of the awakening Bloodlust, who's rage distracted his pursuers long enough for him to escape. Finally came Penthos the Dying who in a flash of power after a blow from the still raging Bloodlust caused him to forever destroy the forms of other would-be incarnates, including the unnamed incarnation of magic who was still being taught by Yonda Noe. The grief from this loss struck both Penthos and Zoin dearly, with Zoin refusing to create more incarnate forms so as not to lose them and Penthos never healing the neck wound that made him cause the event. Not all was lost however as when the dust settled the immovable form of the Bearer of Scales Fidi Maka sat still intently listening to Yonda Noe's unending lectures, before they stood up and brought immediate order to the chaos of the incarnates mountain birthplace. This beacon of hope was not without its shadow though, as from the destroyed forms came an amalgam of unlife called Adiexodo the Never-Living who swore vengeance on Fidi Maka for stealing the powerful form that should have been his before being whisked into the shadows by the now revealed Tromazo.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"flags":{},"_id":"m4S82uXwrS0kTe4o"}
