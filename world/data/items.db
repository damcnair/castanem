Crafting is completed in 2 hour chunks. Some branches of crafting must make all their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some do not (like Blacksmithing or Enchanting). A crafting roll is made every 2 hours of work on an item.</p>\n<p>On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours.</p>\n<p>If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Crafting During a Rest</h2>\n<p>During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a crafting project if you do nothing else during the long rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a −5 to all Passive Perception checks as you are focused on your craft.</p>\n<p>You can make 2 hours of progress on any crafting project by taking this @Item[NpvM9u1ZZxuq1QMe]{Camp Action}.

In many cases, attempting to craft without the applicable tool is impossible. Your GM may allow improvised tools, and in that case the check is made with disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat source, and some require more infastructure. These are generally approached logically and are at the discretion of the GM. For an adventurer looking for more portable workshop tools, investigate the Crafting Magic Spells and Crafting Utility Magic Items sections; these offer additional avenues for increased portability</p>\n<p>Here is a list of some of the additional requirements by branch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blacksmithing can perform minor crafts with a simple heat source, but requires a forge and anvil to make new items.</li>\n<li>Alchemy and Cooking almost always requires a heat source.</li>\n<li>Tinkering, Jewelcrafting, and Poisoncraft sometimes require a heat source.</li>\n<li>Enchanting, Scroll Scribing, Woodworking, Wand Whittling, Poisoncraft, Leatherworking, Engineering, Runecarving rarely require anything besides the tools of the profession. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Expertise</strong></h3>\n<p>Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are calculated into your crafting roll modifier, but do not add to an the calculated DC the effects of that item have.</p>\n<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>\n<p>A crafting roll is a special type of ability check and you can’t add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic Inspiration or the spell guidance) as the crafting roll represents the entire time you spend working the item.</p>\n<p>In general, the intention is that no external bonuses apply, unless they specifically state they do. This would include feats (such as ones that allow you to reroll certain rolls), class features (such as ones that allows you to add dice to certain rolls), etc. A GM can apply these bonuses, but they are not intended to work, and can result in checks becoming too easy.</p>\n<p>You can gain can advantage if another player with proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Taking 10</strong></h3>\n<p>When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours to 4 hours per check) to “take a 10” on the crafting roll, meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability score + your related tool proficiency bonus. This provides a floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take your time.</p>\n<p>If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire duration of the crafting, the crafting check doesn’t gain any bonus, but can be completed in the standard 2 hours.</p>\n<h3><strong>Workdays</strong></h3>\n<p>When a character is spending all day working, they make 8 hours of progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a crafting project during a day. Players will occasionally want to work longer than 8 hours, but this fails to account for the limitations of mortals: player characters still need to eat, sleep, and will eventually lose their focus and ability to work. This is primarily implemented for balance reasons, but also helps model how much productive time a character can spend; they are not just working 8 hours straight and idling for 8 hours, but rather a model of the natural flow of a day, taking breaks, etc.</p>\n<p>A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme crafting days in special circumstances, but in almost all cases working over 8 hours on a crafting project would leave a character with one or more levels of Exhaustion.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":1,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

When traveling in groups most tend to delegate these tasks different members, but when traveling with a skilled Ranger whose specialized training is designed for survival outside civilized society they may take on the bulk of these tasks alone. These rules are primarily intended for adventures that value the exploration pillar of D&amp;D, and should be avoided by those with smaller campaigns where travel is either done in short bursts, is infrequent, or has been simplified to the point that these rules are unnecessary.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Quick Reference</h2>\n<p>While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to go about a day of travel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your travel pace from Slow, Normal, or Fast.</li>\n<li>Choose who will cover what tasks from Provisions, Threat Avoidance, and Navigation. At least one character must be designated as the meetup point, this person is the centerpoint the party follows and can only be assigned to the Navigation task and only while another character is already assigned to it.</li>\n<li>Each character covering a task chooses the Skill they wish to use to complete the task and if it is not the default skill of the task provide an explanation for how that skill assists in the task. </li>\n<li>Each character makes a task roll of 1d20 + your chosen Skill modifier. If multiple characters are assigned to the same task then so long as one of them succeeds the task is completed. If one character is assigned to multiple tasks, unless they are a Ranger, they have disadvantage on each check. Only two characters can be assigned to any one task before more become redundent.</li>\n<li>Because these checks are meant to simulate multiple Skill Checks that would be made throughout a day they are not able to be assisted by temporary bonuses (such as <em>Guidance</em> or Bardic Inspiration). These checks can also not be given advantage in any way not listed here, with the exception of Inspiration.</li>\n<li>The DC for each check is determined by the DM from the <em>Travel Check Modifiers</em> table while taking other potential factors into account. The rewards for success depend on the check made but typically mean safe passage, accurate navigation, and being provided enough food through foraging to not need to consume rations.</li>\n<li>Failing a check means that the task was failed and mean being attacked, getting lost, or using precious rations. Failing a check by a meaningful amount can cause additional problems as determined by the DM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Travel Pace</h2>\n<p>This section is here to reiterate the default 5e rules for travel pace for convenienct reference.</p>\n<h3><strong>Travel Pace</strong></h3>\n<p>While traveling, a group of Adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any Effect. A fast pace makes Characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to Search an area more carefully.</p>\n<h3><strong>Forced March</strong></h3>\n<p>The Travel Pace table assumes that Characters Travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of Exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each additional hour of Travel beyond 8 hours, the Characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.</p>\n<p>The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of Exhaustion (see Conditions ).</p>\n<h3><strong>Mounts and Vehicles</strong></h3>\n<p>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than Humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh Mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, Characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other Land Vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to Travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Certain Special Mounts, such as a Pegasus or Griffon, or Special vehicles, such as a Carpet of Flying, allow you to Travel more swiftly.</p>\n<h3><strong>Travel Pace and Effects</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:98.8848%;height:68px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.4849%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>        Pace</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.0762%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Distance Traveled Per Minute</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:8.93179%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Hour</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:9.8823%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Day</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:36.121%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.4849%;height:17px\">Fast</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.0762%;height:17px;text-align:center\">400 feet</td>\n<td style=\"width:8.93179%;height:17px;text-align:center\">4 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:9.8823%;height:17px;text-align:center\">30 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.121%;height:17px\">-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.4849%;height:17px\">Normal</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.0762%;height:17px;text-align:center\">300 feet</td>\n<td style=\"width:8.93179%;height:17px;text-align:center\">3 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:9.8823%;height:17px;text-align:center\">24 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.121%;height:17px\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.4849%;height:17px\">Slow</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.0762%;height:17px;text-align:center\">200 feet</td>\n<td style=\"width:8.93179%;height:17px;text-align:center\">2 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:9.8823%;height:17px;text-align:center\">18 miles</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.121%;height:17px\">Able to use Stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong></h3>\n<p>The Travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But Adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered Difficult Terrain.</p>\n<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in Difficult Terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Travel Checks</h2>\n<p>Travel Checks are designed to simplify the activities that adventurers would perform as daily routines during times of extended travel. During the early years of an adventurers career they will need to take care to make sure they have constant access to food &amp; water, can navigate to their destination without losing their way, and are capable of avoiding (or fending off) any potential threats. As a characters talents grow and the years go by they will begin to find that they no longer need to put as much effort into the more mundane tasks as they used to. Once an adventurer becomes an experienced veteran whose actions can shape countries, they have most likely learned enough during their travels to never need risk running out of food or water (either through magical means or simply knowing the best places to access such resources).</p>\n<h3><strong>Task Delegation</strong></h3>\n<p>There are three types of Travel Checks: Provisions, Threat Avoidance, and Navigation. Whenever the DM calls for Travel Checks each character may either delegate themselves to one of the three checks or choose to do some other activity (some of which are listed in the <em>Suggested Activities</em> table). Up to two characters can be delegated to a check at once, any more and they simply end up stepping on each others toes. When two characters are helping each other with a task they both roll whatever skill they choose to use for the check (both characters can use different skills) and if either one succeeds it counts as a success for the check. </p>\n<p>When delegating tasks, one character must be chosen as the meetup point and is in charge of following the path layed out by whoever is navigating and giving each other character a spot to make their way back to. The only Travel Check the meetup point can be delegated to is the Navigation Check, and only if they are not the only one delegated to this check.</p>\n<p>If the party is traveling with any mounts that are not pulling a vehicle, being ridden, or otherwise able to follow the party on their own, then at least one party member must take the <em>Handle Animals</em> activity from the <em>Suggested Activities</em> table or else risk the animal wandering off. Likewise, if the party is riding in a vehicle such as a<em>Wagon</em> or <em>Carriage</em> then someone must perform the Pilot <em>Vehicle</em> activity or no progress can be made without abandoning it. Both of these activities can be performed by whoever has been chosen as the meetup point.</p>\n<h3><strong>Making the Roll</strong></h3>\n<p>The DC of a Travel Check is determined by <em>Travel Check Modifiers</em> table based on the conditions the party is traveling under. For example, if a character is using their Wisdom (Survival) to navigate while moving at a slow pace in bad weather the DC for the check would be 11 (12-3+2). Depending on the circumstances failing a Travel Check by 5 or more can lead to more disastrous consequences than normal, sometimes caused by the character and other times simply by bad luck.</p>\n<p>Because Travel Checks are meant to represent multiple points of spread out effort throughout a day of travel, they cannot be affected by any temporary bonuses to your roll (such as <em>Guidance</em> or Bardic Inspiration). These checks can also not be given advantage in any way not listed here, with the exception of Inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unlike other Ability Checks, if the roll of the die for a travel check is 20 then even if it would normally be a failure the character manages to succeed at their task, even if by dumb luck. Likewise, if the roll of the die is a 1, then even if that would normally be a success the task goes wrong in some way as decided by the DM, sometimes through no fault of the character. In both these cases the success or failure of the check should bring about a somewhat memorable scenario that does not need to paint the character who rolled is either a positive or negative light, but can instead represent the randomness of the universe.</p>\n<h3><strong>Provisions</strong></h3>\n<p>During travel it is important to have constant access to a source of water, food is also important and still a part of finding provisions, but having access to water is a must unless an adventurer has a method of carrying enough water for their journey. Gathering provisions means searching the area around you are traveling for food (hunting game, harvesting edible plants, etc) or searching for water (finding a stream, drained from a cactus). </p>\n<p>On a successful Provisions Travel Check, a character finds enough water to fill 8 waterskins (32 pints) and enough food to feed 5 people (1 <em>common fresh ingredient<sup>KCC</sup></em>). If a party is traveling along a path with a clear and present source of water (such as a river) or chooses to forgo searching for water, then the amount of food the party can gather is doubled.</p>\n<p>On a failed Provisions Check, the party fails to find enough for and water to sustain themselves and they each must consume their required amount of food and water from their own stocks.</p>\n<p>If a party decides for any reason to forgo the search for Provisions then they can either choose to perform other tasks (such as helping another character with a different Travel Check) or can instead @Item[I676jwenKxQKTMG2]{Gather} useful items from their surroundings.</p>\n<p>The default skill to be used for Provision Checks is Wisdom (Survival).</p>\n<h3><strong>Threat Avoidance</strong></h3>\n<p>The reason many merchants choose to travel with bodyguards is that the world is full of dangers both monstrous and human. While your party travels it is imperative that someone makes sure to keep watch for potential threats, or else even a skilled party can be worn down by attrition. Avoiding a threat does not strictly mean going around it and can include scaring off stalking predators, quickly killing a scout before it can call for more, or finding a hidden path through a dangerous monsters territory. Although sometimes, even with someones best efforts, conflict cannot be avoided and this check can help give you the edge in a necessary fight, or spot an ambush on the only path to your destination.</p>\n<p>On a successful Threat Avoidance Check, a character manages through some combination of scouting, deterrence, and course correction, to avoid a potential threat (or lessen the danger of an impending one).</p>\n<p>On a failed Threat Avoidance Check, a character fails to notice a threat encroaching on the party and as such they must suffer the consequences of it. This threat can take the form of many things ranging from combat encounters, an unnoticed trap, or an unavoidable encounter that could have been prepared for.</p>\n<p>The default skill to be used for Threat Avoidance Checks is Wisdom (Perception).</p>\n<h3><strong>Navigation</strong></h3>\n<p>Arguably the most important part of travel as even if you can fight your way through anything, or have an infinite supply of provisions, you can't make it to your destination if you get turned around at every step. Navigation is not simply just following an already layed out path or blindly following a map. The job of the navigator is to make sure the way is clear, they are heading in the right direction, and that the path they are following is correct. Even if the party is traveling with a map on a paved road, someone must make sure there are no issues and that the party is always going the right way, usually by scouting ahead but it can also be done in ways such as asking others for directions or finding fallen road signs in the grass.</p>\n<p>On a successful Navigation Check, a character manages to find a path that avoids any non-threatening obstacles (which is the job of Threat Avoidance) and travels around any avoidable obstacles, although sometimes situations arise which may cause a less optimal path to be taken out of necessity.</p>\n<p>On a failed Navigation Check, a character fails to navigate the party correctly and they end up delayed in some way. This could range from things like wasting some of your day looping back around from a wrong turn to getting lost around an a similar looking environment and ending up back where you started your morning.</p>\n<p>The default skill to be used for Navigation Checks is Wisdom (Survival).</p>\n<h3><strong>Trained for Survival</strong></h3>\n<p>Rangers are a class that are naturally geared towards being wilderness survival experts in at least some capacity. As such, they are capable of taking on many tasks at once while traveling without being burdened by the multitude of tasks. </p>\n<p>A character with at least one level in the Ranger class can be delegated any amount of Travel checks at once without any disadvantage being imposed on the checks. In addition, when assigned to every task, a Ranger can choose to perform a singular Travel Check instead of three seperate ones, but most use their Wisdom (Survival) for the roll.</p>\n<p>If a Ranger has less than three Travel Tasks delegated to them, then they have advantage on any Travel Checks they make.</p>\n<p>When a Ranger fails a combined Travel Check, the DM secretly rolls a d10 to determine what goes wrong. On a 1-3 they failed to navigate the party correctly, on a 4-6 they failed to find provisions, and on a 7-9 they failed to notice a threat. If the result was a 10 then the DM rolls 2d10, rerolling 10s, and then either two points of failure occur, or one failure becomes more threatening to the party of the same result is rolled on both die. If the combined Travel Check is failed by more than 5 the Ranger fails at every task but only suffers the consequences of a normal failure.</p>\n<p>In the case of Tier 1 play when a Ranger is delegated to Provision Checks and either/both Navigation and Threat Avoidance Checks, but has to make multiple rolls of the latter and only one roll of the former and wishes to combine them, they make the three rolls as normal but only the first roll risks failing the Provision Check. In this case when the DM roll rolls d10 to determine what check fails, a 1-5 means failed navigation while a 6-10 means they failed to notice a threat.</p>\n<p>In addition, characters who have the Wanderer background feature follow the same rules listed here for Rangers, but can only be delegated for Navigation and Provisions checks without penalty, and only gain advantage on one of those tasks if another character has been delegated to the other.</p>\n<h3><strong>Learning Through Experience</strong></h3>\n<p>As each character grows in level, so too does their passive ability to travel the land safely. With each new tier the party reaches they have less chance of being accosted by weaker monsters or losing their way in a mundane traveling location. Refer to the <em>Travel Checks by Tier</em> table when deciding how many Travel Checks should be rolled, and how often they are made.</p>\n<p>If the party ever finds themselves in a particularly strange or hostile place (such as the Shadowfell or Feywild) then the rules should be followed for the tier below what the party currently is. And if the party ever finds themselves in a location that makes little sense or is completely alien to the party (such as Pandemonium) then treat them as two tiers below (minimum of Tier 0).</p>\n<h3><strong>Travel Checks by Tier</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:98.8848%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:17.5831%;text-align:center\"><strong>Tier</strong></td>\n<td

After 8 hours of travel, the time it takes to gain the benefits of a Short Rest increase to 8 hours and Long Rests increase to 96 hours (or 4 days). </p>\n<p>If a party rests in conditions above the standards of what can be called \"camping\" while still constituting rough conditions (such as sleeping in a farmer's barn on a stack of hay) they can complete a Long Rest in 48 hours (instead of 96) so long as they don't travel during that time. If they manage to find the optimal sleeping conditions that soft bed a hot meal would provide (such as from an Inn or magically available abode) they can complete a Long Rest in 24 hours (instead of 96) so long as they don't travel during that time.</p>\n<p>Once a party completes a Long Rest while traveling, the time it takes to take Short and Long Rests returns to normal until they initiate travel again.</p>\n<h2>Call of Adventure</h2>\n<p>Once per travel session a party may come across a moment where they feel the need to push themselves in order to accomplish a task. This may be because they found a mysterious ruin after they wondered from their path, have been traveling in search of a villains lair and finally found it, or simply are traveling a particularly dangerous area and feel they need frequent rests in a single days travel.</p>\n<p>In any case a party may choose to at any point during travel to heed the Call of Adventure. Heeding the Call of Adventure returns the time it takes to benefit from Rests to their normal lengths for 24 hours, after which they return to their travel lengths.</p>\n<h3><strong>Legitimate Call</strong></h3>\n<p>The Call of Adventure is designed to simulate the adrenaline rush an adventuring party may feel upon coming across an exciting opportunity or dangerous situation, and as such it is up to the DM to determine if a Call to Adventure is legitimate. Simply using one because it is available to them or they decided the journey is taking to long and wants to regain a spell slot to cast Teleport are not legitimate reasons, but forcing yourselves to travel a longer distance to reach your destination on a time limit or to prepare for a suspected ambush in the next town are.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Homebrew","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":1,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

While Alchemy often deals in poisonous reagents, typically speaking they aim to tame the poison, channeling it into useful effects. While capable of making crudely poisonous potions, such things are generally considered failures to an alchemist. To a poisoner, they are considered the art itself.</p>\n<p>Poisoncraft shares Reagents with Alchemy; for details regarding those, see @Item[IsMu5VTMmarCcxw4]{Alchemy Rules}</p>\n<h2>Quick Reference</h2>\n<p>While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a potion in its most basic form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select a poison that you would like to craft</li>\n<li>Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that potion.</li>\n<li>Use your Poisoner’s Kit tool to craft the option using the number hours listed in the Crafting Time column.</li>\n<li>For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with a Poisoner’s Kit. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.</li>\n<li>On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Related Tool &amp; Ability Score</h2>\n<p>Poisoncraft works using Poisoner’s Kit. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any poisoncraft crafting roll. Poisoncraft uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, representing your path of knowledge to the art of making deadly things deadlier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Applying the Poison</strong></h3>\n<p>Applying an Injury to a weapon or a Contact poison to an object, requires a poisoner’s kit and proficiency with it. To attempt to apply the poison without a kit, make a Dexterity ability check with a DC of 15, adding your proficiency if you are proficiency with a poisoner’s kit. On a failure, the poison is not applied and you suffer the effects of the poison.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Crafting Roll</h2>\n<p>Putting that together that means that when you would like to create potion, your crafting roll is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Poisoncraft Modifier</strong> = your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\" style=\"text-align:center\"> </div>\n<h3><strong>Poisoncraft Saving Throw</strong></h3>\n<p>When a poison requires a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and does not change once it is created.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Poison DC</strong> = 8 + your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice).</p>\n<h3><strong>Success and Failure</strong></h3>\n<p>For Poisoncraft, after you make the crafting roll and succeed marks your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting item (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Poisoncraft do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.</p>\n<p>If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Poisons</h2>\n<p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types:</p>\n<p><strong>Contact.</strong> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Injury.</strong> Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage.

Lycanthropy is a curse that takes hold of your mind, body, and soul, all of which you must fight to maintain control over. On the first full moon the victim faces they will have no control over the transformation on any aspect, the bestial spirit that resides in them takes full control and they must spend the night acting on its wims before awakening in the morning with only a dream-like memory of their actions. This transformation lasts for roughly 8 hours, from the time the moon rises until it sets. After this transformation the strength of the spirit fades somewhat and the victim must make a choice on whether to give in to this spirit or attempt to wrest control of their body back and master their new dark power (these rules assume the second).</p>\n<p>After their first full moon a lycanthrope (assuming they have chosen to control their gift), can begin making saving throws to maintain control over varying aspects of their being. Beginning from the second full moon they experience, the lycanthrope can make three saving throws to maintain control:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constitution Saving Throw</strong>: If the lycanthrope fails this saving throw, their body transforms into their hybrid from until the end of the full moon. The lycanthrope does not benefit from a long rest over the night and gains a point of exhaustion at sunrise (in addition to the one caused by the transformation).</li>\n<li><strong>Wisdom Saving Throw</strong>: If the lycanthrope fails this saving throw, they lose control over their body and the beastial spirit within takes control for the length of the transformation. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the personality shift instead lasts for 24 hours. During this time the lycanthrope takes on the personality of their bestial spirit and must act accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Charisma Saving Throw</strong>: If the lycanthrope fails this saving throw, their alignment shifts to that of their bestial spirit for the length of the transformation. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the alignment shift instead lasts for 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These three <strong>Control Saving Throws begin at DC 15</strong>. Whenever a lycanthrope succeeds on a saving throw to resist a full moon, the DC for that type of saving throw is permanently reduced by 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>What They Represent</strong></h3>\n<p>Each one of these saves represents a different aspect of a person's being, for the curse of lycanthropy can show itself in a multitude of ways. Someone who resists the physical transformation might lose their minds in the process and allow their beastial spirit to possess themselves in their untransformed state, leaving the spirit to run rampant in that form. On the other hand, one can also succeed in holding off the spirit completely on a mental and spiritual level while failing to keep hold of their own body. In this instance one would be stuck in their transformed state perfectly lucid but having to suffer a night in their new form.</p>\n<p>One can also only partially fail to keep hold of their mental state, either losing their mind to the spirit while their soul resists its influence and keeps it in check, or keeping hold of their faculties while becoming influenced by the spirits nature (usually by becoming easily irritable or prone to violence).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Becoming a Monster</h2>\n<p>After a lycanthrope has made all of their saving throws, the actual transformation begins. Beginning with their first transformation a lycanthrope takes on the unrefined characteristics of their beastial spirit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: The lycanthrope retains both its current and maximum hit points when transforming, as well as any temporary hit points. Any changes to these is reflected when transforming back.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: When a lycanthrope transforms they retain their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores while gaining the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the form they take. If the lycanthrope has been exposed to any magical sources that increase the limits of its physical abilities above 20 then that score is increased while they are transformed by the difference between their new limit and 20.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement Speed</strong>: The lycanthrope has the same movement types and speed of the their beastial spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Armor</strong>: The lycanthrope has AC equal to 10 + their Dexterity modifier + their Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>: The lycanthrope has the same natural weapon attacks as their beastial spirit (i.e. the same as other lycans of the same kind).</p>\n<p><strong>Attack</strong>: The lycanthrope can make one attack using any of its natural weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiences</strong>: The lycanthrope loses all of its proficiences while transformed, this is caused by a combination of working with an unfamiliar or incompatible body and their beastial spirit clouding their mind during tasks that require focus. The lycanthrope does retain their proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>: While transformed, the lycanthrope loses all class and racial features it might have, replacing them with the features of its new form. </p>\n<p><strong>Uncontrollable Transformation</strong>: The lycanthrope can only transform during the night of a full moon and cannot transform at will.</p>\n<p><strong>Painful Transition</strong>: The transformation into hybrid form is a long and excruciatingly painful process involving stretching skin, reforming muscles fibers, and breaking bones. As such, the transform takes 10 minutes to occur and is loud as the the victim howls in pain and the sound of their bones cracking echo into the distance. Even just the process of the beastial spirit spreading its influence in your mind causes immense pain, regardless of whether the transformation physically occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited Invulnerability</strong>: During the early stages of mastering lycanthropy, the lycanthrope's defenses are considerably lacking compared to their feral counterparts. The lycanthrope only exhibit their species' famous immunity to conventional weapons during the night of a full moon, during which time they have immunity to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that comes from a non-magical non-silvered source. When not under a full moon the lycanthrope instead has vulnerability to any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage caused by a silvered weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhausting Ordeal</strong>: After reverting back into their original form, the lycanthrope suffers one point of exhaustion from the strain of their transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving Through Experience</strong>: The lycanthrope's hybrid form gains more strength as its humanoid form improves. Whenever the lycanthrope's proficiency bonus increases, they can increase one ability score of their choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of their choice by 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mastering the Transformation</h2>\n<p>A lycanthrope who fights for control over their condition must go through a slow and difficult process of controlling their new power. In the beginnings of this process they will be a danger to themselves and those around them, and as such most who follow this path choose to isolate themselves away from those they may harm. The mastery of lycanthropy can be greatly helped by a teacher, an experiences lycanthrope who has already gained control over their power, or even one who gave into their curse but is willing to help another learn to control it. Whatever method one finds a teach, they will most likely need to pay in more than just gold. </p>\n<p>A lycanthrope on the path to mastering their abilities can choose to train their abilities through meditation and study, or by spending time in either their hybrid or beastial form. The lycanthrope gains 1 <strong>Mastery Point</strong> for every 8 hours they spend on mastering their condition, and twice that if they are under the guidance of a mentor. As they gain more mastery points, more abilities and methds of control will become available to them as shown in the <strong>Transformation Mastery Progression </strong>table.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Transformation Mastery Progression</strong></h3>\n<table style=\"width:99.2443%;height:527px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:7.36711%;text-align:center;height:34px\"><strong>Mastery Points</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:91.9984%;text-align:center;height:34px\"><strong>Mastery Improvement</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:7.36711%;text-align:center;height:34px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:91.9984%;height:34px\"><strong>New-Moon Lycan</strong>: You just begun your journey towards mastering your lycanthropy, you follow the base stats listed in the <em>Becoming a Monster</em> section.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:7.36711%;text-align:center;height:17px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:91.9984%;height:17px\"><strong>No Longer Normal</strong>: You gain an appropriate feature from their beastial form that persists even while you are not transformed.

Crafting does not make things from thin air, it makes more useful things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally found in three ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Loot &amp; Salvaging</h2>\n<p>Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main sources of materials will be the things you find. Nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the party.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gathering &amp; Harvesting</h2>\n<p>How something is gathered varies on the profession; in many cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Dragon scales, for example, are a lot easier to gather when there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it harvesting rare herbs, monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an opportunity you won’t want to pass up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Purchasing</h2>\n<p>Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into you hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any craftsman: money. When you don’t have what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its selling price is usually half of that to an interested property.</p>\n<p>Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a party that does not have a use for them, and will only sell to interested parties that can use or resell them.</p>\n<p>Threatening to burn down a merchant’s shop because they will not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check, but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily intimidated.</p>\n<p>The sources of materials are tied to the pillars of the game. Looting and Harvesting are tied into the combat pillar, Salvaging and Gathering are tied into the exploration pillar, and purchasing and rewards are tied into the social pillar. This provides a lot of routes to add these materials to your game based on what works best for your group. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Types of Materials</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Reagents</h2>\n<p>Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.</p>\n<p>There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These categories include curative, reactive, and poisonous. These each come in the standard material rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.</p>\n<p>Reagents can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).</p>\n<p>Reagants can be assumed to weigh 0.2 pounds each.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Magical Ink</h2>\n<p>While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with magical ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of scrolls. This is synthesized by alchemists from the magical properties of reagents, as it is concerned with extracting their magical properties, the exact nature of the reagents used do not effect the final ink beyond its potency.</p>\n<p>Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own, though it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM could rule that some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or dragon could be counted as such. It is generally created from reagents or purchased from alchemists that create it from reagents.</p>\n<p>Magical ink can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).</p>\n<p>Magical Ink can be assumed to weigh 0.1 pounds each. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Essences</h2>\n<p>While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more purified forms of magical power. These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.</p>\n<p>You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.</p>\n<p>While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section. Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.</p>\n<p>Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many paths to each desired outcome, and this flexibility is represented in Essences. While the traditional way to make a belt of hill giant strength may call for a hill giant heart as its essence, an enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their primal essences to make a belt of dragon strength that just has the same statistical effect.</p>\n<p>Essences can be assumed to weigh 1 pound each.</p>\n<h3><strong>Salvaging Essences</strong></h3>\n<p>You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete, and doesn’t work if the item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic item is one that recharges or doesn’t have a limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses.</p>\n<p>The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Synthesizing Essences</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You can combine reagents in the following ways:</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.162%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.7104%;text-align:center\"><strong>Essence</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5853%;text-align:center\"><strong>Component Reagents</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.7104%;text-align:center\">Arcane</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5853%;text-align:center\">1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.7104%;text-align:center\">Primal</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5853%;text-align:center\">3 reactive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:32.7104%;text-align:center\">Divine</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5853%;text-align:center\">2 curative, 1 reactive</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This process takes 4 hours, and requires Alchemist's Supplies and a heat source.</p>\n<h3><strong>Making Essences</strong></h3>\n<p>Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically only suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting feature can create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8 hours a day); this process can’t be completed faster and for the duration they are considered to have spent all of their spell slots.</p>\n<p>At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this way, a caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon essence this way, a caster at 11th level can make a rare essence in this way, and a caster at 17th level or higher can make a very rare essence this way. Legendary essences require special rituals, more casters, and take far longer; they are exceedingly hard to make.</p>\n<p>The type of essence produced depends on the source of the spell casting levels as per the table below:</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.162%;height:238px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Caster</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Essence Type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Artificer/Inventor</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Arcane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Arcane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Cleric</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Divine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Druid</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Primal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Monk</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Psionic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Occultist</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Any*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Paladin</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Divine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Psion</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Psionic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Ranger</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Primal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Varies*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Warlock</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Varies*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:46.4888%;height:17px\">Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.8069%;height:17px\">Arcane</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Special Cases Explained</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sorcerers </strong>produce a type based on their subclass; Dragon or Wild makes Primal, Divine Soul makes Divine, and Shadow makes Arcane.</li>\n<li><strong>Warlocks </strong>likewise produce a type based on their subclass; Archfey makes Primal, Celestial makes Divine, and all others make Arcane.</li>\n<li><strong>Occultist </strong>can produce any type, but takes 1.5x as long to produce an Essence in this manner.

They are assumed to be relatively pure and weigh 2 pounds each. The default ingot listed in all the crafting tables is an ingot of Steel. These cost 2 gp per ingot. There are cheaper metals (such as Iron); pure Iron can’t be used to craft weapons and armor, but can be used for other items, resulting in a cheaper item. On the other end of the spectrum, more advanced metals such as Mithral and Adamantine can be used conferring special properties, but being far more difficult to work with and costing more.</p>\n<p>Ingots can be assumed to weight 2 pounds each.</p>\n<h3><strong>Salvaging Ingots</strong></h3>\n<p>Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently, but require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item, a metal item can be rendered down into its component ingots. Advanced metals may require special tools to smelt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Smelting Ore</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a suitable facility. For more details see the Components and Materials table under @Item[f1UqCs4UdwCYeFwH]{Blacksmithing}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Hides &amp; Leathers</h2>\n<p>Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from monsters. Leather is a product of hides that can be processed from what it is harvested from the monster.</p>\n<p>The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or carapace. Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger creatures simply provide more hides, and monsters that are not large enough to produce one hide provide only hide scraps.</p>\n<p>Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales can be much larger or small from different-sized creatures. The system does not attempt to say how many scales a creature provides or how many literal actual scales makes up scalemail, but rather provides a number that is then consistently used.</p>\n<p>Creatures are harvested using a Survival check, with its DC listed @Item[JV3l61WH2ZHsXdL9]{below}. If the DC check is failed, the harvest does not fail entirely, but instead they get 1d4 hide scrapes in place of any hides, carapaces of one size smaller, and half as many scales.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Parts</h2>\n<p>The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.</p>\n<p>In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things “too small to track” which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).</p>\n<p>Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table, and are generally minor.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Named Components</strong></h3>\n<p>In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock” for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.</p>\n<h3><strong>Salvaging Parts</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What can be salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general common items provide parts, uncommon or expensive items may provide fancy parts, and esoteric parts are found only from esoteric sources at your GM’s discretion. Tools, vehicles, and complex items generally return 1d4 metal scraps and 1d4 parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal scraps for a Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized item, and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare types of parts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Wood</h2>\n<p>Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher quality woods are often found in rather exotic locations. Wooden branches (including wood scraps) are assumed to be of a useful wood that can be worked, while firewood covers everything else, with more useful woods falling into categories such as “quality branches” or rarer options.

Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It’s a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started—and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How To Craft</h2>\n<p>Crafting under this system is very simple. You collect the ingredients for a particular thing you want to make, and use your skills with tools to make it into that item. The crafting time of this system is very compressed compared to the systems you might find in the base options because this system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.</p>\n<p>Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle. You might need a little time here and there, but it will be measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently, the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly use gold to buy those materials in some cases.</p>\n<p>Following there is a quick summary, as well as more indepth break down of crafting time and checks, materials and where to find them, and finally the specifics of each branch.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Generic Ingredients</strong></h3>\n<p>Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like “common curative reagent” rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a “common poisonous reagent” and used as such in crafting.</p>\n<p>This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.</p>\n<p>Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.</p>\n<p>Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though it is up to your GM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Quick Summary</h2>\n<p>Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following serves as a summary and reference for the process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Select an Item. </strong>Find the item you would like to craft on a crafting table.</li>\n<li><strong>Check with your GM</strong>. They will confirm if that item exists and has the default rarity in their game. This system is a tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.</li>\n<li><strong>Gather the materials</strong>. Materials can be looted from humanoids, harvested from more exotic creature types, purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The specifics of any material and where it can be found is covered in the materials section. </li>\n<li><strong>Begin crafting!</strong> You can find the related tool and ability score on the table below. Use the related tool and skill to determine your crafting modifier using the following formula:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Crafting Modifier</strong> = your Related Tool proficiency bonus + your Related Ability Score modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2 hours spent, make a crafting roll using the formula above and compare the result to the DC listed for the item.</li>\n<li>On failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting fails and all materials are lost.</li>\n<li>On success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can mark your progress put it aside or continue to craft. </li>\n<li>Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the crafting time listed, the item is complete.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re done!</strong> Enjoy your shiny new item!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Special Reminders:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can “take 10” on a crafting recipe by doubling the crafting time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The final say on any item is up to your GM. If they disagree with the written recipe, they are correct! • Don’t be afraid to ask where you can find materials—the GM wants you to engage with the world and find things!</li>\n<li>A crafting roll is a special kind of check. You can’t apply boosts other than expertise to your crafting check. In general, the only way other than expertise to boost a crafting roll is to get help from another skilled crafted for the entire duration of the craft. Remember you can use the take 10 option to get slower more certain success, and if a craft has a higher DC than you can achieve using that method, it likely should involve some degree of difficulty and risk.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Quick Reference</h2>\n<table style=\"width:99.2453%;height:221px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Profession</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Related Tool</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Related Ability Score</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Alchemy</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Alchemist's Supplies</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Wisdom or Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Blacksmithing</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Blacksmith's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Strength</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Cooking</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Cook's Utensils</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Wisdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Enchanting</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Arcana</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Engineering</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Carpenter's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Jewelcrafting</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Jeweler's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Dexterity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Leatherworking</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Leatherworker's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Dexterity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Poisoncraft</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Poisoner's Kit</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Wisdom or Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Runecarving</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Varies</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Wisdom or Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Scrollscribing</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Calligrapher's Supplies</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Tinkering</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Tinker's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Intelligence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Wandwhittling</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Woodcarver's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Dexterity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:31.1908%;text-align:center\">Woodcarving</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.7054%;text-align:center\">Woodcarver's Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width:31.3432%;text-align:center\">Dexterity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Reference Prices</h2>\n<p>The prices of this system reference the default prices presented for magic items in 5e, as follows.

The caterpillar then begins crawling over and repairing the object or area, taking 10 minutes for every cubic foot it repairs (minimum of 1 minute). The caterpillar can physically repair a magic item or construct, but can't restore magic to such an object.
