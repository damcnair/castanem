They primarily work out of the Judges Spine where their main bases of operation are located and have even had the city of Spirekeep form around their main base, the Court of the Iron Rainbow. At one point in history the arbiters once served directly under the Bearer of Scales before they were killed by a scheme of the Never-Living. Now the Council of the Peaks, a group of 15 dragons of different races, serve as the highest rank of the arbiters. They follow and enforce a strict set of laws and codes known as the Tyrell accords which set a standard of decency for each country. Each member of the arbiters is allowed to enforce the law of whatever land they are currently in but once they begin a judgement they must adhere to the commands of the higher ranks of that locations law enforcement as if they were a member until the case is settled. This means that a higher rank in the arbiters equates to a higher rank in a countries law enforcement, with a standard enforcer being the equivalent of a normal guard.</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Main Purpose</span>: To bring about fair and impartial justice to those who break the Tyrell Accord, a set of meticulously crafted laws that each country has agreed to follow as a standard for decency. This treaty allows members of the arbiters to operate as law enforcement in any country to different degrees depending on the members level.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Types of Members</span>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Dragon Worshippers</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Judges</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Peacekeepers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Names</strong>: The Monastery of Divine Judgement</p>\n<p><strong>Core Principles</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To uphold the Tyrell Accord, as communed by the Bearer of Scales and penned by Chief Justice Tyrell, down to the punctuation.</li>\n<li>To respect dragonkind as the purest representation of the material planes barring the incarnates themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leadership Structure</strong>: As a religious organization the role of leader is officially the Bearer of Scales Fidi Maka. But in her absence a group of 15 dragons called the Council of the Peaks are the highest authority for organization shifting decisions while an elected official called the Chief Justice runs the rest. A councilmember selects a member of their kind to replace them at the time of their death and typically each member has a selected successor that they might train for the position.</p>\n<p><strong>Prominant Members</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Noxicaal (Ancient Black Dragon)</span>: The second oldest and cruelest of the members of the council. He is said to live in the deepest depths under the Judges Spine where he trains the arbiters emergency forces the \"Ebony Adjudicators\" with little supervision.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Zarithen (Adult Blue Dragon)</span>: Guardian of the southernmost entrance to the Judges Spine, he extends his protection to the villages and trade routes around that part of Nuln in exchange for regular donations of wealth.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Athenarax (Adult Green Dragon)</span>: The councils resident strategist and the singular offspring of the green dragon of the original council. She regularly competes in games of full-sized Dragonchess with nobles that bet precious treasures in exchange for boons if they win.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Kore Scorchwing (Young Red Dragon)</span>: Kore is the only member of the council  to live in Spirekeep alongside Servanus. The offspring of the previous red dragon on the council and one who boasts of him winning the right of succession against his now deceased siblings. Kore performs patrols over the city and its surroundings alongside his guard regiment the Sky Scorchers.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rejarkonas (Adult White Dragon)</span>: Residing on the far north of the Judges Spine on the border of the Rentkar Dynasty. She enjoys adding the frozen figures of any and all of Rentkar's undead that wander over the border to the walls of her icy lair.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Clevarkyss (Adult Brass Dragon)</span>: The designated negotiator of the council that many have claimed to have seen flying overhead to arrive as a neutral party to international negotiations. He is said to have spoken to every governmental leader for the last 5 centuries during his position on the council.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Vaxinaad (Young Bronze Dragon)</span>: The bronze engine of war rumored to back to the Centurial War. It is unclear whether she is simply taking the name of her predecessor on the council from the time of its founding or if she is truly the original reborn.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Reiloreben (Ancient Copper Dragon)</span>: Known as the \"Metallic Minstrel\" Reiloreben maintains his lair in the Gregon Empire. He has been known to allow travelers who find their way past his (relatively) harmless traps to hear his collection of songs from throughout history and sometimes even teaches dedicated bards his craft.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Vossgil (Young Gold Dragon)</span>: The youngest and most recently elected councilmember. Vossgil is known for his aloofness, rarely showing himself except for the rare council meeting. Because of this not much is known of him other than his tendency to watch the training sessions of the dragon monks.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Servanus (Ancient Silver Dragon)</span>: The oldest member of the council and the only one other than Noxicaal to be a truly original member. It is very easy for people to see Servanus as he regularly roams Spirekeep in his human guise, though rare even to arbiters is a chance to see his almost unseen true form. A millennia of spent fighting in his human form has given him a wealth of experience in combat and he is known to pick up promising recruits to train, even forming a rivalry with Noxicaal over their training methods.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Raimentos (Adult Amethyst Dragon)</span>: The councils designated specialist when it comes to dealing with treaty violations that involve the outer planes such as fiend summoning. According to rumors he is said to live under the holy Lake of Knowledge in Kayron but as that would be sacrilege most don't believe them.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Matron (Ancient Crystal Dragon)</span>: The second member of the council to represent the crystal dragons. A number of the current council members were raised by her and maintain friendlier relations with her then most dragons have with their parents. The councilmembers she has apparently raised are Kore, Rejarkonas, and Vossgil.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Robdanius (Adult Emerald Dragon)</span>: Constantly traveling from settlement to settlement in disguise as an animal some part out of curiosity and other parts information gathering. He is in charge of the arbiters information gathering division but some think that’s just an excuse to explain why there are so many hunters with stories of killing game only to end up with a angrily apologetic dragon staring them down.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Jutessevox (? Sapphire Dragon)</span>: Basically nothing is known of this mysterious member of the council. Most if not all of the other councilmembers have enough stories or sightings to get an idea of their character. In the case of Jutessevox the only thing that is known of her is her name that was publicly announced on her joining in 1060.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Retrogast (Adult Topaz Dragon)</span>: The only current councilmember to outwardly express loyalty to a deific figure other than Yonda Noe, Bahamut, or Tiamat. She worships The Rotten and leads a grove of druids who acknowledge the necessity of destruction in the natural cycle, much to the ire of many other druids.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Chief Justice Ambus (Topaz Half-Dragon Winged Tiefling)</span>: The public face of the Spectrum Arbiters and the one who most consider their leader even if the council ranks above her. She was elected in 980 and has guided the arbiters through an era of peace with a focus on providing aid to the people in order to reduce crime wherever they can. Although she is known to be kind Ambus is also known to shoulder the responsibility of executing criminals in Spirekeep if it is necessary, giving them a solemn departure as a pile of dust on the wind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Impression</strong>: The Spectrum Arbiters are almost universally seen as trustworthy keepers of law. That does not mean they are universally respected though as some also see them as authoritarians or fear them as agents of dragons watching Castanem's people.</p>\n<p><strong>Base of Operations</strong>: The arbiters work out of the mountain range known as the Judges Spine in three major locations spread throughout. Those locations are the Highpoint Garrison, the Temple of the Material Fist, and the Court of the Iron Rainbow. The garrison is the central garrison of Spirekeep and a place where most members are trained through guard work. The temple is a more advanced training facility that trains the bodies and will of its students into disciplined martial fighters. The court is the main base of operations for the arbiters and is a colossal mountain fortress that houses most of the higher level members, hosts council meetings, and is generally considered a holy site for worshipers of Bahamut, Tiamat, or Yonda Noe.</p>\n<p><strong>Locations Active</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Spectrum Arbiters are active in all civilized areas of Castanem enforcing the laws of the Tyrell Accord.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initiation Process</strong>: A typical member of the Spectrum Arbiters looking for enforcement work first joins the Highpoint Garrison in Spirekeep and works as a city guard in hopes of being selected for promotion to a better trained position. Alternatively, those looking for a more religious or judicial position (commonly the same thing) can take years of lessons offered in Spirekeep and apply for a position in the arbiters.</p>\n<p><strong>Racial Tendencies</strong>: Because of the nature of the arbiters and the circumstances of their founding their members tend to have draconic ancestry. This typically includes kobolds, dragonborn, and half-dragons but the arbiters does not discriminate by race and accepts all comers.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Criminals in general find the arbiters to be a pain to deal with as they consist of better trained and more thorough officers that are out to arrest them.</li>\n<li>The arbiters also seem to have a special disdain for the roaming bandit/mercenary guild the Blazeclaw Freebooters, although no one is even sure why this is the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Uniform Details</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The uniform for standard enforcers is standard leather armor with the badge of the arbiters pinned to the shoulder.</li>\n<li>The uniforms of higher positions tend to have colored fabric underneath their armor, metal trimmings, and/or gems embedded into it. Some are even allowed to incorporate real dragon scales into their armor as a boon, something that is normally frowned upon since other than a gift the only way to acquire dragon scales involves harming them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Iconography</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The symbol of the arbiters is of a gem with five visible faces each representing a different color of chromatic dragon. It is standard for these to be made of painted iron.</li>\n<li>Their banner is of their symbol on a nearly black dark blue background.</li>\n</ul>"},"_id":"aHeBzjDmP0OR4kZh","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Headquartered in Lagiakos, the company has been called on by the empire on numerous occasions throughout history, including during the Centurial War, to tackle high-risk threats that the nation’s military would struggle to mobilize against quickly enough to ensure a positive outcome. The relationship has been so mutually beneficial that many people now consider the Legion something of an unofficial elite extension of the imperial military, but the company has been known to take contracts from the other nations and private clients.</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Main Purpose</span>: The Legion is out for the same honor, glory, fame, and fortune as most other mercenary companies are. But their path to it prioritizes the defense of their country and those who call it home. They seek, second only to the safety of their people, to set the gold standard for mercenary work on scales large and small.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Types of Members</span>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Career mercenaries and soldiers, and other individuals who are skilled fighters</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Spies and other intelligence personnel</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">A handful of magic users with skills that support the organization’s needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Names</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Legion - the commonly accepted colloquialism is quick and easy and short</li>\n<li>Scarves - a derogatory term referencing the scarf or cloak that serves as the company's rank insignia. Calling a legionnaire “Scarf” could be either an insult (implying low skill or rank), a threat (implying intent to remove said scarf from its bearer), or both.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Core Principles</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect the Empire and its allies from anything that would do it or its people harm.</li>\n<li>Conduct business in such a way that it paints mercenary work in a positive light.</li>\n<li>Honor, glory, profit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leadership Structure</strong>: The company’s overall structure closely mirrors that of the imperial military. Almost without exception, the Legion has been commanded by a member of the Drakos family since it was founded centuries ago. The position is largely a ceremonial one driven by tradition, but the vast majority of commanders have been remarkable warriors and leaders in their own rights. The Legion’s current commander is Astraea Drakos, who shares her duties with her husband, Hektor. They get involved personally with as many contracts as they can, and their “lead from the front” style of business has won them the unwavering loyalty of both clients and those under their command.</p>\n<p><strong>Prominant Members</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">General Astraea Drakos (Half-elf): </span>The current commander of the Legion, Astraea is a harsh woman with an abrasive personality. She’s known throughout the mercenary and military community for being extremely hard to bargain with and even harder to impress.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">General Hektor Drakos (Half-elf):</span> Hektor is a brilliant tactician and daring commander who prefers to win battles before they start through preparation, intelligence gathering, and training. He’s easier to talk to and compliments his wife well, but he’s no pushover.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Captain Verin Shan (Tiefling)</span>: Verin oversees the Legion’s training and recruiting programs. What she did before taking the position with the Legion is a mystery to many, but she’s extremely well connected, and that’s a useful thing to be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Impression</strong>: The Legion has a very good reputation, even outside of Gregon. They’re known for being professional, timely, and effective, and it’s rare for a client to share anything less than a glowing review of their services. The only people who don’t have good things to say about them are the kinds of people they’re trying to stop from running rampant and hurting others.</p>\n<p><strong>Base of Operations</strong>: The company is headquartered in Lagiakos, but has established a presence in a number of other cities to ease the burden of commanding a large force spread across multiple regions. These secondary bases are located in Pavlaros in the southeast, Magnisos in the west, and Edyros to the north.</p>\n<p><strong>Locations Active</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>All over Gregon for the most part, but it’s not uncommon to see them taking high profile jobs in other areas, especially near Gregon’s borders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initiation Process</strong>: You don’t find the Legion, the Legion finds you. It’s not uncommon for commanders from other mercenary outfits to forward recommendations to the Legion’s recruiters in the hopes that one of their standout employees will catch Shan’s eye, but more often than not, it’s reputation that gets someone noticed. Those who manage to garner the Legion’s attention receive invitations to come train with them. Training lasts for six months to a year and serves as an evaluation period. Those who make the cut are extended a job offer. Those who don’t, don’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Racial Tendencies</strong>: The Legion is made up of people from all races and walks of life.

This year I am planning on looking into the method of reproduction for the various Merrow tribes. Over the years I have managed to get my hands on some of their cadavers and have discovered that although the many tribes have varying amounts of genetic differences (such as the sharptooth's more pronounced teeth or razorfins sleeker body structure) they all have very similar internal workings. These workings strangely enough seem to include a complete lack of reproductive organs. I have heard that the \"Sirens\" of the Dead Ice have the same strange trait, I will have to see if I can convince someone in the expedition to fetch one for me (Sten?).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>2nd of the Month of Seeds, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>I've sorted through my notes on Merrow dissections and am even more intirgued then previous. In addition to the afformentioned lack of a reproductive system the Merrow's seem to have a higher then average amount of vestigial bones and organs with pronounced diferrences in amount between even members of the same tribe. What could cause this?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>22nd of the Month of Timber, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>I have had Bordil set aside a variety of different species of fish that have been caught in fishing nets that are deemed inedible. A lack of interest in the biology of the more mundane creatures of this world has been replaced with a fascination with the lifeforms. It seems the oceans bring about an abundance of strange genetic traits that I have ignored for too long. These dissections will most likely occupy me for a short time while I wait for an opportunity to acquire another Merrow cadaver to compare notes too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>28th of the Month of Timbers, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>I fine gift has arrived for me to celebrate the end of Spring (even if it is a little sooner than expected). Bordil and a few others in the expedition managed to ambush a lone Merrow and have brought me its body, in exchange for the promise of butchering it for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>1st of the Month of Clans, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>This body, oh this magnificent body. It brings with it such wonderful insights, it is easily the oldest Merrow I have had the honor of dissecting but even still its body show signs of growth. The possibilites for this are boundless, perhaps Merrows go through a form of metamorphosis? Or they might be indeterminate growers sections into phases of their life? No matter what I must study this body further, I will be informing the hamlet that I have found a disease in the meat and that it is unfit for consumption. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>10th of the Month of Clans, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>A BREAKTHROUGH! After comparing the bodies of some more fish that have been brought in by Bordil, bless his heart, I have discovered some minor differences in biology between older specimens. After comparing dissection notes I realized the changes  seem to have started occuring as Summer approached in preperation for spawning season. After I realized this I heavily suspect the Merrow go through a similar process during this season but cannot yet explain the purpose or cause. I have dissected other Merrow's slain during Summer before and found no evidence of this change. Neither can I determine the purpose of such a change, the vocal cords seem to become more taught while the muscles bulge apart without increasing strength. Perhaps to attract a mate? But Merrow do not seem to have gender. An increase in size would normally indicate wish to attract something or thicken their hide for temperature regulation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>10th of the Month of Songs, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>Incarnates be damned, I appear to have caught a nasty sickness just as I was in the stride of my research. The villagers have brought some herbs meant to help but they seem to think anything green will heal and anyone intelligent can do alchemy, neither of which are true. I might spend next year researching basic curatives to prevent this in the future, but for now I am at least smart enough not to chew on a poisonous herb. I don't wish to taint specimens with an ill-timed coughing fit so for now I will create some simple essence to pass the time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>19th of the Month of Songs, 1112</strong></em></p>\n<p>In all my years I didn't think he could do it, Sten has actually managed to slay a Siren. He says it was a mighty battle and has the scars to prove it but I suspect the one he fought was weakened somewhat before he engaged it. Either way I have precious little time before the damned village idiots plan to have a grand feast of this magnificent cadaver and I must begin the dissection. Sten has informed me in advance that I would not be able to claim this corpse unfit for consumption after last month and I don't blame him either, with this magnificent scent I have never been so tempted to nibble on a research subject.

It is a world heavily influenced by religion but has also pushed the gods away to the fringes to the point worshiping them is akin to paganism. The incarnates, embodiments of concepts, have all but replaced the gods in the prayers of the people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The current calendar has its years split between two sides of a defining moment in its history, Before Incarnates (BI) and After Incarnates (AI). Year 0 on this calendar represents the year the incarnates took form and began influencing Castanem directly. Most taught history occurs after this point, and many point to 65 AI as the year that most affected the countries that make up Castanem. This is because 65 AI marks the start of the Centurial War, a century long period of active warfare that involved every country on Castanem and the effects of which can still be felt to affect Castanem to this very day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The Centurial War covers much of the most influential moments in history such as the rise of the Rentkar Dynasty, the formation of the alliance of desert nations that would eventually become Nuln, and the grouping of fleeing dragons worshipers around the Bearer of Scales that formed the Spectrum Arbiters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">When the incarnates first came into being they quickly became the targets of worship as many people flocked to the corporeal incarnates over the gods of the outer realms. This influx of worshipers of the incarnates weakening the influence of other religions allowed the shift in the Kingdom of Kayron (who worshiped the incarnates teacher Yonda Noe as their state religion) to the completely god-driven Kayron Theocracy known today. They fought on the side of Old Rentkar in opposition of the Gregon Empire during the Centurial War.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The country that would eventually become the Rentkar Dynasty began the Centurial War by purging all forms of non-incarnate based religion. The reason for this decision was later revealed to be the manipulations of the One of Strife in order to sow the seeds that allowed the Never-Living to eventually slay the Bearer of Scales. The war was ended when the lich Rentkar conquered the kingdom in the middle of winter and sending out peace treaties and trade agreements to each country when spring came. The name of the country that came before Rentkar seems to have been lost to time and is usually just referred to as “Old Rentkar”.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">It wasn’t until long after the Centurial War that the country of Nuln would be formed, before it was the Nuln Desert containing many small countries. During the war these countries choose to band together to sign a treaty that promised they would offer no special protections towards religions and stop trading with the Gregon Empire in exchange for being left out of the war. This treaty came back to bite the Kayron-Old Rentkar alliance when after travel through the mountains was blocked by the Bearer of Scales they refused Kayron access to their borders in order to continue invasion of Gregon, an act that is said to have ended the war as Kayron was forced to sign a non-aggression pact with the Gregon Empire. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The Gregon Empire stood firmly at the center of the continent as the country that valued the freedom of its citizens so much that it fought half the world to keep it. The fact that they eventually one this war has heavily influenced their culture in way both good and bad. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>"},"_id":"fGXN7Q6BdLTloMbK","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Inside it was written that the entire Centurial war was started via the manipulations of Tromazo in order to build to this one moment, the death of justice. The war was intended to cause the followers of the old draconic gods to flock to Fidi Maka for protection and allowing Corvus' grandfather to become close to Fidi Maka. The three generations of Blazeclaws were all undead warlocks of Adiexodo and spent the 150 years preparing a spell throughout the mountains designed to kill an incarnate.}</p>\n<p>{Upon finding this journal the Council of the Peaks decided to cover up the truth of Fidi Maka's death by making it seem like it was done by other incarnates.

My theory is that the way Bloodlust’s nature influenced its form was to make it everpresent, chaotic and a terrible thing, but a part of every sentient being, an impulse to resist.</h3>"},"_id":"gBszOTQJ7plwb1lB","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Many have heard of them but less know exactly what they do. Rumors started about 2 years ago, about a group of women who cleared out the ghosts from an abandoned city  on the borders of Nuln and Gregon. Some flocked to see the spectacle of witches and spread the word of healers and ghost hunters known as Zelen Zaliv.</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Main Purpose</span>: Although most known for ghost-hunting, healing is their main priority. They want getting better to be easy, cheap and accessible to all people. The Witches cure those who can be cured, heal those who can be healed, and make tools and gadgets to make the lives of the disabled easier. And on occasion will clear out ghosts and undead. </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Types of Members</span>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"color:#191813\">Zelen Zaliv raises magic users of any kind though favors those with healing prowess</span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"color:#191813\">Tinkerers and blacksmiths </span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"color:#191813\">The Coven has an unnatural number of women despite everyone in Zelen Zaliv being related</span></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"color:#191813\">There are two types of Witches Protectors and Healers Protectors are warriors who travel with and protect healers (hence the name).  </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Names</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">The Green Witches/The Green Coven - Zelen Zaliv translates to Green Coven in North Dwarvish and many refer to them as such in common</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">Miracle Makers - This term was spread after the Witches cleared the ghosts that have been plaguing the unnamed city on the border of Nuln and Gregon since before the centurial war. It is much more known in Gregon after Zelen Zaliv cured a young noble of her blindness and the rich family started referring to them this way. </li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\">The Escapees - Many have reached the consensus that these Witches came from Rentkar. A group of Witches left the Dynasty and disappeared some months before the appearance of this “New Coven”. A rumor says one of them escaped the Rentkar Lottery (The Witch of Absconsion as she is known) and the rest of the coven ran from their homes in fear of the lich. And despite their thick accents, name, and the innumerable amount of evidence, the Coven still refuses to confirm such claims. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Core Principles</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cure those who need to be cure, Heal those who need to me healed</li>\n<li>Help without profit and do good for good's sake</li>\n<li>Roam the land in search of the needy and help</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leadership Structure</strong>: The Coven is led by three Witches known as the Four Arms. Given this title because two of the women have prosthetic arms so the three women only have four functioning arms between them. Many of Zelen Zaliv are nomadic and spread their healing to the world but these three women stay within their city at all times. Though they are the leaders, most of the Covens' decisions are put to a vote. All the Witches' voices are heard equally and any major decision is made up only once every member has said their peace. </p>\n<p><strong>Prominant Members</strong>: : </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Four Arms: The leaders and supervisors of Zelen Zaliv. Their Healing Prowess is not on par with many of the other Witches in the Coven but they are chosen for their quick minds and excellent leadership. </li>\n<li>Supreme Komet Majiya: One of the Four Arms, she is known for her potions, it is said that she has a potion for any occasion and any need. She is maybe the most eloquent of the leaders and has a very warm personality.</li>\n<li>Supreme Edno Majiya: One of the Four Arms, she is known for her tinkering. She makes wondrous creations to help people and solve many problems. She even made her own prosthetic arm. Before becoming a leader she used to help raise the children of the coven, she still retains her softness towards children. </li>\n<li>Supreme Matalni Majiya: One of the Four Arms, she is known for her metal work. The harshest of the four arms she imbues her magic into armor and weapons. She leads the small defense force within the coven. </li>\n<li>The Witch of Absconsion/The Witch Who Cheated Death: Rumor has it a witch escaped the Rentkar lottery and this is what caused the coven to move to the south. The Witches completely refuse to talk about this but her name is believed to be Galdronhym Majiya.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Public Impression</strong>: They are almost unanimously liked except by their main enemies the Spell Burners. The people of Gregon appreciate their help and Zelen Zaliv is always a welcome sight within the Empire. They have made friends all over the world but do not travel to the far north. </p>\n<p><strong>Base of Operations</strong>: Their main base is on the border of Gregon and Nuln. The City’s name is long forgotten but is known as Border Town, or The Border Ghost Town. It now is exclusively populated by these witches, and used as a base of operation and hub. </p>\n<p><strong>Locations Active</strong>: They are a mainly nomadic people who travel the entire world to spread their healing. Most prominently in Gregon (because of the very common violence within the empire) and Nuln (because of not only their adjacency but because of the many medical problems that come from a country of mages, and scholars.)</p>\n<p><strong>Initiation Process</strong>:  You have to marry into the family Majiya or be born into it. Not much is known about the magical teachings of Zelen Zaliv but no woman in the coven is without magic. They say that less than one percent of the  children born into the coven are men. So almost any man within the coven got there by marriage. </p>\n<p><strong>Racial Tendencies</strong>: The entire coven is almost exclusively Half-Elf. There is a small number of people they call “Dream Weavers” (Kalashtar) who share some tendencies with the native people of Kayron and are usually found within the Silent City. </p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: No one has actively attacked Zelen Zaliv except for the Spell Burners. The coven has made many tools and magic items to help people, and the Spell Burners have made it very clear that they are not a fan of this. After an incident where the Burners stole and destroyed a young girl's prosthetic leg, the coven stopped marking their wares with the symbol of the Zelen Zaliv to try to prevent the spell burners from destroying more of the items that they have made. </p>\n<p><strong>Uniform Details</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Healers all wear a large Witch’s hat while traveling</li>\n<li>The protectors are usually wearing black armor with gold trim</li>\n<li>They both wear either a black or green cloak with embroidery on the back (this embroidery is usually of the Coven’s symbol but can vary person to person. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Iconography</strong>: The symbol of the coven is many hands reaching for the sky (sometimes depicted as stars, the moon, clouds, but is most often reaching for the sun. Their colors are green, black, gold, and silver.</p>"},"_id":"FrHzqqH9QZNJJKYt","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3,"FGPHYlVc2qA4X7ZA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

This constant abuse of the law to protect themselves from consequence has led them to have something of a rivalry with the Spectrum Arbiters.

Normally such things can be determined by a master telepath probing your willing mind but given your abilities that does not seem a possibility, which is in of itself an exciting prospect. I wish to give you a task, and if you are able to complete it I will both have your instructor sign off on your trainings completion and a place as a valued member of my staff which would provide many opportunites one of such advanced age such as yourself would not normally find.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Your mission, if this offer interests you, is to follow a woman by the name of Amara Drakos. She is the younger of the two twin daughters of the rather famous Drakos family (of the Drakos Legion). My sources say that her older sister, Melaina Drakos, was responsible for the destruction of a village in Gregon and has since disappeared. A few months after this Amara was spotted in the port city of Harcosa sporting a rather grotesque plant-like right arm. She seems to be looking for passage to Paradia and I would like to request you to follow her and attempt to subtly garner the location of Melaina from her using your powers. Or failing that, maintain a distance you are comfortable with and find Melaina by investigating Amara's actions and associates.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Do these things and your wishes will be granted and more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">From, an Eager Patron</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">*Attached to this letter is a sketch of Amara*</em></p>"},"_id":"HXsVTCnc58JbEgzp","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3,"JUPK8PoinF46Nf17":1},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

That is until in 1105 when the first recorded incident of them using anti-magic items, for which no explanation has been found for where they come from. These items include arrows that drain magic to tinder that forms a field of anti-magic when burned in a fire. Once these began use they quickly rose to become a threat spellcasters needed to watch out for. Instances of spellcasters needing to travel with martial bodyguards become more common as ambushes by the Spell Burners had now become an actual threat. While still made up mostly of untrained commoners, these commoners could now (if rarely) come equipped with items that could turn a mage into a vulnerable target. Most still see the Spell Burners as an organization of no consequence, especially since there seem to be more splinter cells that claim to be members than actual members, but the threat still remains nonetheless. Their credo of being fine with natural magics also tends be changed or lost in these splinter cells because there have been numerous cases where psykers, sorcerers, and even races with magical anatomy like dragonborn have been harassed either by mistake or by a misunderstanding of their own rules.</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Main Purpose</span>: To stop the spread of magic as a power that people control.

Some of them you may know but other are new to you and appear to be native to this land. Here are some of what appear to be native creatures:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Piranhadon</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Medium</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Extremely aggressive in packs, will back out of a fight when numbers twindle.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 2 (alone); 4 (in groups)</h3>\n<p>Closely resembling a hybrid of sharks and frogs piranhadons are known for their ravenous nature. They are amphibious, meaning they can survive on both land and in water, a trait they use to their advantage. When one finds potential prey they emit a sound only perceptible by their own species and begin following their prey from below. When a piranhadon hears the call of another it begins heading towards the source and once enough have gathered they swarm the target, either from all directions underwater or by drilling through the ground when on land.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Piranhadon King</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Huge</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Extremely aggressive.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 7 (alone); 9 (with subordinates)</h3>\n<p>The rare piranhadon that lives long enough to die from old age (which is estimated to take roughly a century) can be as small as the day it first became an adult. What exactly produces a piranhadon king is unknown, but it is said that piranhadons that routinely give off the signal for finding prey slowly gain a following of others of its kind that see it as their leader which triggers their growth. In addition to their impressive size kings are able to use a now fully developed organ to store large amounts of freezing cold water inside themselves, which they can fire like a winter wolves ice breath or use to coat themselves in icy armor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Siren</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Large</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Lures in prey with their singing.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 5? (estimate)</h3>\n<p>Not much is known about these creatures, even their appearance is shrouded in mystery. From what rumors say they have large shark-like fins and humanoid arms. What I can say is true is that they have a hypnotic voice that entrances those who hear it to enter their lair even at risk of their life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Merrow</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Large</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Will aggressively attack weak or single targets, while coordinating attacks on larger prey.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 4 (alone); 9 (when in groups)</h3>\n<p>A society of sapient fishmen who find great pleasure in bullying those weaker then themselves. They are genderless creatures whose typical method of attack is to harpoon air-breathing creatures and drag them to the depths where they can watch them either freeze or suffocate. The merrows have many different tribes dotted along the coast of these lands, each showing the same base physiology with small differences between tribes such as more pronounced teeth or slender bodies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Winter Wolf</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Large</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Will assess potential preys threat level before attacking.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 3 (young); 5 (adult); </h3>\n<p>Large elementally inclined wolves that domineer over the Frozen Pines. They exist alongside standard grey furred wolves but will easily force them out of their own hunting grounds if food is ever scarce. Even when young they are large enough to be a threat and so they begin hunting with the pack even in their early years. Fully grown winter wolves are the largest threat however as with age they gain the ability to exhale an icy breath similar to that of a dragon's. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Rippletraps</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Huge</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Passive hunters</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 2</h3>\n<p>One of the more subtly threatening creatures in these woods, rippletraps enjoy burrowing their way under the snow and laying out their large extremely flat bodies across the ground. When a creature of sufficient weight (and small enough size) steps on a rippletrap they spring from the ground and smother their prey until death. The telltale sign of a rippletrap is of the large circular ripple patterns that appears in the snow after they vibrate underneath it, which is what gives them their name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Catoblepas</h2>\n<h3><strong>Size</strong>: Large</h3>\n<h3><strong>Diet</strong>: Omnivorous</h3>\n<h3><strong>Temperament</strong>: Passive unless provoked; Extremely aggressive when protecting mate or offspring.</h3>\n<h3><strong>Threat (1-10)</strong>: 10</h3>\n<p>I have only heard of these creatures so I can only describe what I have heard second hand, but their smell is notorious enough I would believe these tales from the simple fact their tellers reeked of death. Their stench is descirbed as death itself, a mixture of swamp gas and carrion, overpowering to the senses and enough to make even the strongest of stomachs vomit. The visual descriptions all seem to differ except for the fact they are covered in matted fur, have boar-like tusks, and a clubbed tale. The most deadly rumor of them I have heard as that a simple glance from one at close range is enough to kill a man dead on the spot, baseless legends I would say if it were not the terror in the face of the man who described said legend to me.</p>"},"_id":"qAR99sysvNEP4q2d","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

These rumors state that she is responsible for a fire that destroyed a hamlet in western Gregon resulting in 46 confirmed casualties, 28 heavily injured, and 19 surviving with only minor injuries but without homes to return to, all of which has been confirmed by our network. After this Melaina seemed to disappear and all attempts at locating her have failed, while the rumors seem to be seriously damaging the reputation of the Drakos legion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Recently the younger twin, Amara Drakos, has been spotted in the port city of Harcosa and our intelligence says she is looking for passage to Paradia. Your assignment is to follow her and collect intel on the state of the Drakos family, the validity of the rumors, and the location of Melaina Drakos. Our primary goal with this operation is to acquire an \"in\" with the Drakos Legion, their long established history and considerable fighting force can be of great use to the Delaque family. Whether this objective is achieved through blackmail, an established connection to a potential heir, or other means does not matter, although options that leave us less open to threat are preferred.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">This mission is of minor consequence but has the potential for tremendous payoff, you have been granted as much time as necessary in order to complete it and we leave the intricacies of it for you to decide. Be on the lookout for spies from other families, this information made it to us through rumors which means others certainly know about them as well. If you encounter any spies of other houses you are to use your training to \"deal\" with them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Not much is known about Amara other than she was a member of a relatively prominent newly founded mercenary corp \"The Bloodhawks\" before being recruited into the legion proper and going through their harsh training, being assigned to the eastern border of Gregon, and then dissapearing for roughly 3 years. Her reappearance came with her sporting a grotesque mutated arm resembling tree roots, I have attached a sketch of her to this letter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">We have acquired passage for you on the same ship that Amara plans to take, the \"Silken Hound\", a trade ship that occasionally accepts passengers when they don't have enough merchandise to fill the stores.

This has resulted in so <strong>militaristically minded</strong> that it is normal for civilians to volunteer for some amount of combat training at a young age. A significantly <strong>higher population of trained fighters</strong> has its ups and downs however.

But it also means the country has a <strong>bandit problem</strong> bordering on an infestation given any merc that doesn't find enough legitimate work can easily join in an established gang. There have been attempts by the government to combat this by forming <strong>The Border Guard</strong> to make mercenaries able to find better paying jobs faster and with less risk of non-payment.

As a metaphor, you can consider the average human as plankton while a god would be a megalodon, well in this metaphor an incarnate would be the ocean itself. An incarnate is not just a being that controls an aspect of reality, it is a fundamental concept given form and thought. Unlike a god which is simply an unimaginably powerful being an incarnate is less a living thing and more of a construct housing the very essence of reality in its different shades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">If you believe the legends, it is said that the incarnates have existed since the beginning of existence itself, being influenced by the powers of the old gods. These old gods are those that were once worshipped as we do the incarnates, but have since fallen to the wayside to be prayed to only by pagans. One day, the god Yonda Noe came across a mountain in the vague shape of a human and decided to practice her teachings in front of it. Over the years the mountain absorbed these teachings and eventually awakened, becoming the first incarnate All-Mother Zoin. Alone in the world, Zoin decided to create forms for others like her to inhabit which Yonda Noe would happily teach, excited at the prospect of new entities to learn about.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">First came the One of Courage Tharros whose light acted as a beacon for the other incarnates to follow into their forms, but who's shadow also allowed the One of Strife Tromazo to slip into this world unseen. Next came the Fecundent Anaptyx and her twin the Rotten Golthgora, followed by the  Master of the Hunt Kynigos assisting the Keeper of Twilight Peraste in her search for eternity. When eternity arrived it was as the Racer of Finality Diafigi who quickly kicked a rock at the head of the awakening Bloodlust, who's rage distracted his pursuers long enough for him to escape. Finally came Penthos the Dying who in a flash of power after a blow from the still raging Bloodlust caused him to forever destroy the forms of other would-be incarnates, including the unnamed incarnation of magic who was still being taught by Yonda Noe. The grief from this loss struck both Penthos and Zoin dearly, with Zoin refusing to create more incarnate forms so as not to lose them and Penthos never healing the neck wound that made him cause the event. Not all was lost however as when the dust settled the immovable form of the Bearer of Scales Fidi Maka sat still intently listening to Yonda Noe's unending lectures, before they stood up and brought immediate order to the chaos of the incarnates mountain birthplace. This beacon of hope was not without its shadow though, as from the destroyed forms came an amalgam of unlife called Adiexodo the Never-Living who swore vengeance on Fidi Maka for stealing the powerful form that should have been his before being whisked into the shadows by the now revealed Tromazo.</p>"},"_id":"0oTIpyEF8MGdBjPe","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

These rumors state that she is responsible for a fire that destroyed a hamlet in western Gregon resulting in 46 confirmed casualties, 28 heavily injured, and 19 surviving with only minor injuries but without homes to return to, all of which has been confirmed by our network. After this Melaina seemed to disappear and all attempts at locating her have failed, while the rumors seem to be seriously damaging the reputation of the Drakos legion.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\">Recently the younger twin, Amara Drakos, has been contacted in the port city of Harcosa and our agent with the Legion says she is looking for passage to Paradia to begin a search for her sister in order to capture her for her crimes. Your assignment is to follow her and collect intel on the state of the Drakos family, the validity of the rumors, and the location of Melaina Drakos. Our primary goal with this operation is to acquire an \"in\" with the Drakos Legion, their long established history and considerable fighting force can be of great use to the Delaque family. Whether this objective is achieved through blackmail, kidnapping, or any other unsavory means does not matter, although options that leave her less open to threatening us are preferred.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\">This mission is of minor consequence but has the potential for tremendous payoff, you have been granted as much time as necessary in order to complete it and we leave the intricacies of it for you to decide. Be on the lookout for spies from other families, this information made it to us through rumors which means others certainly know about them as well. If you encounter any spies of other houses you are to use your training to \"deal\" with them.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\">Not much is known about Amara other than she was a member of a relatively prominent newly founded mercenary corp \"The Bloodhawks\" before being recruited into the legion proper and going through their harsh training, being assigned to the eastern border of Gregon, and then dissapearing for roughly 3 years. Her reappearance came with her sporting a grotesque mutated arm resembling tree roots, I have attached a sketch of her to this letter.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\">We have acquired passage for you on the same ship that Amara plans to take, the \"Silken Hound\", a trade ship that occasionally accepts passengers when they don't have enough merchandise to fill the stores. The journey should take 2 weeks, keep a low profile during this time and attempt to get a handle on her personality, after you make port it's up to you to decide what to do.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\">May Yonda Noe guide you on your task, and Diafigi darken your shadow.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;text-align:center\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">*Attached to this letter is a sketch of Amara*</em></p>"},"_id":"W4wkdeeiao7pQxV1","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"B9gnYBRjYSZZpO02":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

She took her guards and studied all knowledge of shapeshifters she could find with them, even taking to wearing a custom-made suit of silvered armor with a silver mask made to resemble her face. slowly working their way through Kessage until the threat was finally quelled after a decade of effort. But they did not stop there, bolstered by the hosts of people who lost their family to the threat, the Silvermanes wiped out all traces of lycanthropy in the region before putting their services for sale to other regions in hopes of refilling the coffers drained by the long campaign.
